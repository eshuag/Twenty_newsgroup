However, it is not the penultimate\\n\\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\\n\\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\\n\\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\\n\\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\\n\\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\\n\\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\\n\\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\\n\\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\\n\\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\\n\\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\\n\\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\\n\\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\\n\\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\\n\\tconversion).\\n\\n\\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\\n\\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\\n\\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\\n\\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\\n\\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\\n\\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\\n\\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\\n\\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\\n\\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\\n\\n>We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we\\n>die.      \\n\\n\\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\\n\\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\\n\\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\\n\\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\\n\\ta more expansive view.\\n\\n\\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\\n\\tarts that humans do?

(yeah right)  In order for *you* to \"not pay for any\\nabortions\" through your tax money, *everyone* would have to \"not pay for\\nany abortions\" through tax money.  If this is the case, then women who\\nhave reasons for \"needing\" an abortion, but are unable to afford it on\\ntheir own, are just \"out of luck\".  Their *choice* is blocked because of\\necononmic hardship--which is part of why they might \"need\" the abortion\\nin the first place--and because *some* people don\\'t want to \"pay for any\\nabortions\".  On top of that, there is the assumed requirement that the\\ngovernemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can\\'t afford it,\\nwhich will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion.\\nThis involves *more money*.\\n\\nSuppose instead there *is* government funding of abortions for women who\\ndesire them but can not afford one on their own.  Those who do not want\\nan abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered (if they can\\nnot afford it on their own), and those who *do* want an abortion will be\\nable to get one and *save the government money* in the process.  How then\\nare you \"paying for\" an abortion?  Rather that abortion is \"paid for\" by\\nthe cost of *delivery* that it *saves* (and then some), and all because\\nwe remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure.\\n(Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery, which is often used\\nas an example of \"elective surgery\" that is not generally paid for just\\nbecause it is desired and can not be afforded.)\\n\\nIf you insist on complaining about \"paying for\" someone\\'s choice to have\\nan abortion when they can\\'t afford it, I will complain about \"paying for\"\\nthe larger costs of *restricting* that choice when they can not afford it.\\nWhy should you pay for someone else\\'s choice?

I remember reading that that sort of \\n>private health insurance is actually illegal in Canada. \\n\\nI have only hear Americans say that it\\'s illegal ... but I could be\\nwrong, just have never heard it from a Canadian source.  our private\\ninsurance has recently balked in Quebec when the Liberals proposed\\nprivatizing some aspects of routine care ... also, our insurance was\\nput in place when no NDP (Labour) governments were in power in any\\nprovince to derail the effort \\'cos they wanted real socialized\\nmedicine.\\n\\n>You\\'re not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one \\n>insurance plan.\\n\\nNo, it is optional ... as it is optional for doctors to accept it.\\nThere are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for\\nexemptions (and one e-mail from a Christian Scientist in Edmonton\\nverified for me that it is indeed negative option).  I guess that you\\ncan argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance, but\\nso far I\\'ve not come across that up north ... and I take pains to keep\\ntabs with news from home.\\n\\n>And that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an\\n>effective cartel-they don\\'t really need to compete because, as you put\\n>it, they\\'re in a \"win-win\" situation and they\\'re guaranteed to turn a\\n>profit \\n\\nBelieve me, they probably had orgasms when they figured that out.  And\\naccording to my sister the yuppie, they pat themselves on the back to\\nthe point of ungraciousness at Chamber of Commerce luncheons.\\n\\n>(Interesting side note-have any new insurance companies started\\n>up-from scratch-since Medicare became standard in Canada?\\n\\nI actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I ...\\nno, scratch that ... there are a few in Western Canada, and *quite* \\na few in Quebec as part of the post-1980 Quebec Miracle (out with the\\nnationalism, in with the French capitalism).  La Groupe des Cooper-\\nantes built a new tower by the Eaton(\\'s) store at Les Terraces, and if\\nyou were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS\\'s Crimetime you\\'d see it as\\nthe well-lit one with double-turrets at the top.  As for Ontario,\\nwhich still dominates and anchors business up north ...\\n\\nCanada is a very old-money kind of place, and the 1989 Free Trade\\nAgreement saw a lot of odd alliances: labour unions and establishment\\nold money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one\\nside, and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and\\nprofessionals on the other.  The final Trudeau administration and\\nthe first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux\\nriches who knew what it was like to make your own money, and that\\nmotivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian\\'s\\ninitiative (Macaroni was against free trade \\'til he did a head count\\nof his caucus after the 1984 election).\\n\\n>It\\'s not really insurance if you don\\'t have alternatives\\n\\nWell, you have to realize that in our society that\\'s like saying\\nthat \"it\\'s not really national defence\" because you can\\'t hire\\nyour own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist.\\n(BTW, there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their\\nportion of taxes, but never people arguing over health insurance\\nalternatives ... and we\\'re talking about a press that is hostile\\nto whomever is in government, regardless of party; one of their\\nfew redeeming characteristics, it seems (-;).\\n\\n>Also, in the April 14 Globe and Mail, there was a letter from the\\n>director of trauma services at St. Michael\\'s Hospital in Toronto\\n>responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in\\n>California and Canada in which some Canadian doctor worried that\\n>American analysts would seize on the results as proof that Canada\\n>rationed vital services. The doctor (I can\\'t recall his name) said\\n>that Canada *is* rationing vital services \"as any physician can\\n>plainly see\". He said that a system in which people are refused\\n>treatment because they can\\'t afford it is no different from a system\\n>in which people are refused treatment because the government can\\'t\\n>afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health\\n>insurance plan. In fairness, he did say that both the US and \\n>Canadian systems are in the same situation.\\n\\nThe only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods of\\nhigh demand, which is more a function of the doctors monopoly\\'s tight\\nfist on the licencing.  An obvious difference is that in such a\\ntransient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling\\nover Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we\\'ve seen recently as opposed by\\nrationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient*\\nsituation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the\\nCalifornia health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationing\\namong the insured population.  With smaller markets, there is much\\nless flexibility when dealing with our insured population than\\nCalifornia (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than Canada in a\\nMUCH more dense area).  So he is correct in that the resources are\\nfixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctors\\nmonopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either\\ncase.  As for being \"refused treatment\" the government of the day\\nwould be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen;\\nCanadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that their\\nhealth care is private while only their insurance isn\\'t ... too many\\npeople have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized\\nmedicine.\\n\\n>I know, I know, the monopoly power of Canadian doctors often leads\\n>them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more\\n>money from the government (another case of businessmen, once\\n>scratched, becoming socialists).  \\n\\nRight, as I\\'ve pointed out above ...\\n\\n>But hasn\\'t that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place\\n>to the other? It hasn\\'t really solved it.\\n\\nEither way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since the\\nchanges in the private medical care resource take place at a slower\\nrate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of\\ndisasters (e.g., Chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart\\ndisease). A doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship \\nand specialty training.\\n\\n>People too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their \\n>insurance when they really don\\'t need to.\\n\\nThat\\'s why I\\'ve argued for deductible and copayments rather than\\neducation, which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are\\narguing for (the leftists?  \"Ah, just let \\'em spend!\" --- yeah,\\nright!).  Also, note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions\\nunder some high dollar threshold ... in most, it\\'s your private\\ninsurance that covers it just like in the U.S.  Still, it all\\nadds up in the OECD measures.\\n\\n>In fact, Buffalo may be the only place in the US where people\\n>get Don Cherry jokes (:-).\\n\\nWe get the Sabres\\' feed as a replacement game on ESPN tonight (the\\nDevils\\' local metro NY coverage supplants the main ESPN game).\\n\\n>(The NDP cleaning up a Tory spending mess? And just when I thought \\n>I understood Canadian politics).\\n\\nYeah, it\\'s a sad story and Saskatchewan Tory leader Grant Devine\\nhas been on a nonstop PR campaign to save his sorry butt.  The\\nSask NDP have taken a neo-conservative turn like Hawke, Gonzalez\\nand Mitterand did.\\n\\n>has anybody considered following Singapore\\'s example and going to a\\n>system where the company and the state buys basic and catastrophic\\n>coverage for everybody, and then you also have an IRA sort of thing\\n>to which you and your employer can can contribute for medical\\n>expenses only? It would tend to discourage you from overusing it.\\n\\nThe medical IRA would have limited use, as you\\'d need a lower\\ncatastrophic threshold else there\\'d still be a drain on the public\\npurse if someone exhausts their IRA.  Also, Singapore has a much\\nmore autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses\\n(if Singaporeans that I\\'ve met are any indication ... I don\\'t\\nmean any disprespect here) where they\\'d let you just die.\\n\\n>One of the good things about being the last country to create a\\n>national health care system, should we decide to, is that we have\\n>everybody else\\'s mistakes to learn from.\\n\\nThat\\'s true ... the question is how much leeway is there between\\nthe U.S. approach and the second-most capitalist approaches of\\nCanada, France and Germany.\\n\\n>>Seriously, there are few areas that have sufficient population for a\\n>>two/more-tiered system like what the French have ... a health policy\\n>>prof, D.G. Shea, has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having\\n>>a population of 500,000 is necessary for adequate competition ...\\n>>and in Canada, there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes\\n>>with that population or larger.\\n>\\n>But there are many cities in the US with that kind of population. \\n\\nYes, many ... and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too\\nfar from a bigger town.  Just take a look at a detailed atlas ...\\nor better, take a flight from Pittsburgh or Rochester to Toronto.\\nMy first time across Lake Ontario to NYC, I was amazed by the\\nincrease in density ... and the Toronto region is the densest \\nin all of Canada.\\n\\n>There was one about a group of doctors in Calgary who have opened\\n>Canada\\'s first US-style MRI clinic, as an alternative to the\\n>provincially owned one.\\n\\nIt\\'s about time!  I\\'ve ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they\\ndon\\'t invest in their own private practices ... in the end, it\\'s their\\nmoney.  But they choose to spend it on America\\'s Cup pipedreams, and\\nthat\\'s none of my business.  As for \"provincially owned\" ... for sure\\nit\\'s against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved\\nin the provision of health care except in the military or native reser-\\nvations.  What that term actually means is that the facility gets by\\non public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding.\\nMedical practice itself is much more conservative up north.  My own\\nbest friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN,\\nand is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first.\\n\\n>There were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of\\n>two-tiered health care and that it might violate the Canada Health Act.\\n\\nNo, it\\'s probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have\\nprivate practices ... and always have.  They can all take cash\\nanyways ... so why not have a particular facility?  The Canadian\\nbig government mentality often imagines government where it does\\nnot even exist ...\\n\\nSince the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less\\nlaidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then Canadians\\ncan do the same.  As I\\'ve pointed out above, the law states that it is\\nillegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for\\nthe military and natives.\\n\\nLook, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ...\\nnobody stopped them when they bought it.  Nobody seems to be stopping\\nthem from using it, either.  Much ado about nothing.  Thank goodness\\nthat hockey playoffs have started ...\\n\\n>While it seemed currently unjustified, there was one anecdote told by\\n>the head of the partnership to demonstrate the MRI. He showed an\\n>image of an injured knee, which happened to belong to the manager of\\n>the bank who approved the loan. He said that without it, the guy\\n>might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial MRI, then\\n>another length of time for treatment, after which the muscles would\\n>have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder \\n>If that isn\\'t the first whiff of two tiers, I don\\'t know what is.\\n\\nI\\'m certain there is exaggeration somewhere, because the GAO study\\nof Canada cited often on USENET did not find access to MRI to be a\\nproblem.  I\\'ll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened \\nto American trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit.\\nThere are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without\\nrelying on MRI ... unfortunately, I\\'ve had a few. )-;  And I\\'m not\\na banker.

There is an XView version called xvgr for\\nSuns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr. Compiling \\nxmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1 and X11R4 - xmgr will \\nnot compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.  X11R5+Motif 1.2 should work \\nfine, but I've not been able to test this.\\n\\nFor a summary of xmgr's capabilities, get the file BLURB from\\neither site mentioned below.\\n\\nAvailable via anonymous ftp to either:\\n\\nftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu:/CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.Z\\n\\nor\\n\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.Z\\n\\nPlease remember to set the transfer type to binary.\\n\\nI am not able to E-mail xmgr, but there are services provided \\nby various Internet sites that allow ftp by mail. You might try \\nsending mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com as follows:\\n\\nSubject: (hit return) Body-of-letter: help (return) quit\\n\\nI've not tried this, but it should give you instructions on how \\nto use this service.\\n\\n2.10 has been compiled and tested on:\\n\\n IBM RS6000 - AIX 3.2 X11R4/Motif 1.1\\n DECstation - Ultrix 4.2a X11R4/Motif 1.1\\n SGI Indigo - Irix 4.0.1 X11R4/Motif 1.1\\n Sun SPARC  - SunOS 4.1.1 X11R4/Motif 1.1\\n HP 720     - HP-UX 8.05 X11R4/Motif 1.1\\n\\nCompiling with gcc should be no problem, but use settings \\nappropriate for K&R C.\\n\\nOf interest:\\n\\nIn light of recent announcements (COSE), I'm suspending further \\ndevelopment of the XView version. For those without Motif on \\nSUNs, I'll provide a compiled binary (eventually).\\n\\nI've begun re-writing ACE/gr in C++, the initial target is\\nMS-Windows.\\n\\nImprovements/fixes from 2.09 are:\\n\\n * The explicit placement of items in popups has been replaced\\n\\twith manager widgets. The previous method led to problems\\n\\ton some servers (all widgets in a popup would get scrunched\\n\\tinto the upper left corner).\\n\\n * Many set operations can now be done in the File/Status popup.\\n\\n * The PostScript driver should do a better job of producing\\n\\tEPSF'able output.\\n\\nA few things remain to do (I could use some ideas/help on these):\\n\\n1. Replace the Hershey fonts used for on-screen text with the\\n\\txvertext routines posted to the net by Alan Richardson.\\n\\tThe problem here is how to include support for this in the\\n\\tuser interface.\\n\\n2. Add support for Adobe Font Metrics. I could use some PD or freely\\n\\tdistributable routines for this.\\n\\n3. Add support for pattern fills in the PostScript driver. Presently\\n\\tthe only way to get hardcopy for fills is to import MIF into\\n\\tFrameMaker. Need PS routines for pattern fills.\\n\\n4. Add support for HDF/NetCDF.

It\\'s compatible with the\\n    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun\\'s NeWS and SunView,\\n    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.\\n    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.\\n    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the\\n    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.\\n    It should not be called `Windows\\' or \\'OPEN LOOK\\' or `OpenLook\\', as\\n    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.\\n    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,\\n    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.\\n    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:\\n\\tSunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0\\n\\tSolaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0\\n\\tSolaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1\\n\\n    See Also:\\n\\tMixing X11 and OpenWindows\\n\\tWhere can I get it?\\n\\n@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?\\n    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs\\n    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography\\n    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here\\'s a brief summary:\\n\\n    OLIT was AT&T\\'s OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;\\n    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were\\n    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,\\n    although you didn\\'t get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the\\n    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in\\n    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in\\n    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a\\n    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).\\n    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably\\n    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or\\n    anything else that uses subclasses.\\n    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]\\n\\n    XView is Sun\\'s toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in\\n    programmer interface to SunView.  There\\'s even a shell script to help\\n    migrate source code from SunView to XView.\\t XView is often said to be\\n    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.\\n    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is\\n    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).\\n    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.\\n    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the\\n    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be\\n    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.\\n    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much\\n    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.\\n\\n    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based\\n    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the\\n    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of\\n    an application.  It\\'s currently included in OpenWindows.\\n\\n    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some\\n    incompatibilities with `tNt\\' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to\\n    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time\\n    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.\\n    You might ask what `is committed to\\' means in this context; the\\n    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.\\n    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.\\n\\n    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++\\n    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from\\n    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify\\n    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be\\n    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the\\n    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.\\n    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of\\n    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in\\n    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).\\n\\n@ Where does Motif fit in?\\n    It doesn\\'t :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that\\n    is being developed by OSF.\\tIt has a `look and feel\\' reminiscent of\\n    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-\\n    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold\\n    reasonably cheaply by OSF.\\tAlthough Motif is currently available on\\n    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly\\n    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a\\n    large installed base.\\n    Sun\\'s CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif\\n    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in\\n    the `Periodic Table\\' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.\\n\\n@ What is MoOLIT?\\n    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between\\n    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V\\n    Release 4.2.\\n    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677\\n\\n@ What about that Display PostScript thing?\\n    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X\\n    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed\\n    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a\\n    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously\\n    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it\\n    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less\\n    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.\\n    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;\\n    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.\\n    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS\\n    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to\\n    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.\\n    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts\\n    available, however)\\n\\nSubject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm\\n\\n@ What are olwm and olvwm?\\n    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window\\n    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows\\n    on the screen, and for managing the user\\'s interaction with the windows.\\n\\n    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.\\n    It\\'s included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and\\n    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.\\n\\n    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop\\' (hence the\\n    `v\\' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the\\n    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.\\t You can\\n    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This\\n    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around\\n    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm\\n    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.\\n    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib\\n    directory; there are three patches).\\n\\n@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?\\n    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won\\'t be able to use\\n    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won\\'t see the\\n    footers some windows use to display certain messages.\\n\\n    If you use twm, you\\'ll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus\\n    and get rid of programs that don\\'t have a `quit\\' button when not run\\n    under olwm.\\n    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:\\n\\tLeftTitleButton \"target\" = f.delete\\n    where \"target\" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.\\n    Alternatively, try\\n\\t# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm\\n\\tLeftTitleButton \":menu\" = f.menu \"OL.menu\"\\n\\n\\tmenu \"OL.menu\" {\\n\\t    \"Quit\"         f.delete\\n\\t}\\n\\n    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title\\n    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).\\n\\n    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).\\n\\nSubject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays\\n\\n@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?\\n    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.\\n    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.\\n    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS\\n    or SunView support, and thus won\\'t run on an X terminal.  This includes\\n    pageview in particular.\\n\\n    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-\\n    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)\\n    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about\\n    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.\\n    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you\\n    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal\\'s\\n    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.\\n\\n\\nSubject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows\\n     \\n@ What configuration files do I need to know about?\\n\\n    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc\\n\\n    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in\\n    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to\\n    edit it somewhat; it\\'s simplest to move it and any other old X11 files\\n    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.\\n\\n    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,\\n    since xdm doesn\\'t look at your .xinitrc file.\\n\\n    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys\\n\\n    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,\\n    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.\\n    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files\\n    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need\\n    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an\\n    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,\\n    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano\\'s \"contool\" program so that\\n    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.\\n    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.\\n\\n    .Xdefaults\\n\\n    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,\\n    it is a good idea to include at least:\\n\\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:\\ttrue\\n\\t*Input: TRUE\\n    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they\\n    forget to ask for it.\\n\\n    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties\\' from the default\\n    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.\\n    Don\\'t put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props\\' deletes them.\\n\\n    .startup.ps\\n\\n    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)\\n    on startup.\\t This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the\\n    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change\\n    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a\\n    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up\\n    at all or will get broken in strange ways.\\tThe NeWS manual gives code\\n    that is both incorrect and insufficient.\\n    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.\\n\\n    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see\\n    the man page for xset (\"man xset\", and \"xset -help\") for more information.\\n\\n    Here\\'s what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of\\n    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of\\n    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for\\n    OpenWindows 3.  You\\'ll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime\\n    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn\\'t include the time to\\n    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your\\n    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...\\n\\n\\t% don\\'t want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual\\n\\t% /IncludeDemos? false def\\n\\n\\tUserProfile begin\\n\\t    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def\\n\\t    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def\\n\\t    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...\\n\\tend\\n\\n    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:\\n\\n\\t/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\\n\\t/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\\n\\t/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\\n\\n\\tClassRepeatKeys pop\\t% force repeat.ps to autoload\\n\\n\\tendpackage endpackage endpackage\\n\\n    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the\\n    OpenWindows server like this:\\n\\t$ psh -i .startup.ps\\n\\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\\n\\t$ psh -i\\n\\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\\n\\t/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send\\n\\t%%% now press control-D\\n\\n    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make\\n    the root window be \"retained\", so that a PostScript drawing on the\\n    background won\\'t be erased when you move windows:\\n\\tframbuffer /Retained true put\\n    will do this.

Also, see\\n\\tthe note about contool, above.\\n\\n@ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults?\\n    Use `props\\', which appears in the default root menu as `properties\\'.\\n    This starts `props\\', a property editor which will re-write your\\n    .Xdefaults after removing comments.

If you\\'re\\n    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of\\n    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.\\n\\n@ Why don\\'t flat check-boxes work?\\n    A known bug may make Guide\\'s output dump core if you use these.\\n    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it\\'s only Guide\\'s output\\n    that\\'s broken, not the actual check-box code.\\n    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you\\'re\\n    still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;\\n    the new one is fantastic!\\n\\n@ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays\\n  on the screen.\\n    Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in\\n    the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin\\').\\n\\n@ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something.\\n    This was a bug related to some systems only.

These notes apply to\\n    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with\\n    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.\\n\\n    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.\\tYou can intermix OpenWindows\\n    and X11R4 or X11R5, they\\'re all compatible in this respect.\\n    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.\\n\\n    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions\\n    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a\\n    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory\\n    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have\\n    /bin (or /usr/bin, they\\'re the same directory on SunOS) earlier in\\n    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you\\'ll get SunView programs instead\\n    of OpenWindows ones!\\n\\n    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11\\n    library directory.\\tThis doesn\\'t matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with\\n    older versions you\\'ll get error messages from X11 programs if you don\\'t\\n    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although\\n    xdm core dumps if this isn\\'t right.\\n\\n    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn\\'t\\n    /usr/openwin.\\n\\n    See Also:\\n\\tEnvironment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).\\n\\n@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found\\n    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.

I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been\\nshown to be consistent in the past.  Overall performance, L/R splits,\\neven matching hitting/pitching styles.  All of these will give me some\\nadvantage if used properly.\\n\\nEVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by\\nlooking at past clutch performance.

When Perez left Sabo in, he\\nwas predicting the future, the next AB.  He was predicting that\\nSabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel.\\n\\nBy supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite.\\n\\n>And I am not dismissing your work.  I\\'m stating my opinion.\\n>You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary\\n>invalid, so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult\\n>to your work.\\n\\nWell, yes.  You are aware of its existance.  You claim to be incapable\\nof understanding it (though I suspect you are simply unwilling).  Yet\\nyou rather forcefully state the opposite.

This is the beef.  It has not proven to be an indicator of\\nfuture performance under *any* circumstances.  At least none that\\nwe\\'ve been able to come up with.  If you know of some where it *is* an\\nindicator of future performance, please let us in on your secret.\\n\\n>It is nice, however, to see that you will consider the possibility\\n>that you actually could have some preconceived biases.\\n\\nMost certainly.  As I have repeatedly stated, if you can come up with\\na study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability, I would\\nlove it!

Or is this\\na prediction for *all* batters who have, over the past few years, hit\\n(xxx amount?)  worse in the clutch than overall?\\n\\nIf you mean the first, then as you say, we\\'ll just have to wait and\\nsee.  But the second is a much stronger statement.  In fact, it\\nsuggests a rule.  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it\\nworked for recent years.  I think you will agree that if the rule\\ndidn\\'t work last year or the year before, that it is unlikely to do\\nany better this year.  Right?\\n\\n>Here\\'s another one for you.

Unless there is reason to expect consistency, a\\nrun proves nothing.  Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to\\ncorrelate from one year to the next?

Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common\\n soldiers began deserting in droves.\"\\n\\n\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of\\n World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman\\'s enemy\\n increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,\\n Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn\\n massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of\\n expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.\"\\n\\nSource: Stanford J.

In 1941, \\nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \\ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \\nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \\ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \\ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \\nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \\nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \\nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \\nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler\\'s policy of \\nextermination of the Jews.\\n\\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\\n\\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \\n\\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \\nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \\nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \\nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \\nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One British\\nsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the\\ndisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. \\n\\nRawlinson wired to his superiors, \\n\\n\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in\\n independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops \\n being without discipline and not being under effective control,\\n atrocities were constantly being committed.\" \\n\\n>Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:\\n\\nCome again?\\n\\n: \"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...\\n>(34 lines deleted)\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n: No wonder you are in such a mess.

Furthermore, the opinons of Jerome do\\nnot count.  He was neither the Church, or the Pope, or an ecumenical\\ncouncil, or a council in general, or an insturment of the Magisterium of\\nthe Church.  He was a private individual, learned admittedly, but\\nsubject to erro of opinion.

The Administration is \\nannouncing a number of steps today in order to underscore its \\ndeep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based \\non its government's commitment to reform.\\n\\n\\nExecutive Review of Cold War Laws\\n\\nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the \\ndesirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations \\nto reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted \\nto revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet \\nUnion has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other \\nindependent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain \\nthat contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the \\nend of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations \\nwith Russia and the other new independent states.\\n\\nThe President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and \\nregulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. \\nsecurity and other national interests, such provisions can be \\nrevised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe \\nTalbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The \\nPresident has indicated that he will welcome congressional \\nefforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThis review will weigh all considerations that pertain to \\nrevision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may \\nhelp to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such \\nprovisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are \\neager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik \\nlegislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President \\nClinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases \\ninvolving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By \\naddressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds \\nof trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between\\nthe U.S. and the other new independent states.\\n\\n\\nReview of COCOM\\n\\nIt is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies \\nthe future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating \\nCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United \\nStates has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export \\ncontrols to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer \\nviewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in \\ncombatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.\\n\\nSteps to Improve the Security Relationship\\n\\nThe President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of \\nefforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security \\nand improve our security relationship with the Russians and the \\nother states.\\n\\n\\nAccelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons\\n\\nIn Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the \\nprocess of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for \\nelimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has \\ndirected the Department of Defense to complete this process well \\nin advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START \\nI.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the \\nother relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be \\nexploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate \\nthis process.\\n\\n\\nMultilateral Test Ban\\n\\nThe two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a \\nmultilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, \\nand that the two governments would consult with each other \\naccordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning \\nconsultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the \\nspecific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States \\nexpects to start this consultative process within the next two \\nmonths.    \\n\\n\\nDetargeting\\n\\nThe two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear \\ntargeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move \\ninto a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need \\nto reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the \\npast to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The \\nAdministration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures \\nthat could enhance strategic stability, including recent \\nproposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   \\n\\nOther Measures to Create a New Security Relationship\\n\\nIn response to the incident involving a collision between US and \\nRussian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to \\ndiscuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian \\nDefense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in \\nlate May.\\n\\nSecretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with \\nDefense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training \\nprogram between our two military forces and to prepare for joint \\nexercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN \\nSecurity Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening \\nsuch training and exercises to include other peacekeeping \\ncontributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, \\nand planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US \\nand Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial \\nMeeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for \\nenhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move \\nconsideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from \\nthe discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also \\nworking with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements \\nin the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of \\nthese initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our \\nparticipation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.\\n\\n\\nMultilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform\\n\\nFinally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of \\ninitiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and \\npolitical reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The \\nAdministration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to \\nassemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries \\nBentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the \\nAdministration is continuing consultation with Congress over the \\nfurther efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of \\nreform in Russia and the other states.\\n\\n                           *    *    *\\n\\nThe Administration believes these steps can increase American \\nsecurity while improving the relationship between the U.S. and \\nRussia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent \\nstates.\\n\\n                               -30-\\n\\n\\n\"),\n",

In comparison, in \\nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \\ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \\ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \\nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \\n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \\nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \\nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \\n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \\n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \\nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \\nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \\nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \\nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \\nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \\nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \\ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \\n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \\nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \\nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \\noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \\nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \\nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \\n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \\nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \\nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \\nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \\ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \\nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \\n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \\nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \\nrespectively). \\n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \\nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \\nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \\nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \\n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \\nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \\n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \\nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \\nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \\nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \\nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \\n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \\n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \\nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \\n\\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \\nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \\ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \\nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \\nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \\nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \\ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \\n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \\nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \\nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \\n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \\ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \\nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \\npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \\n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \\ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \\nand gang affiliation. \\n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \\nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \\n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \\ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \\ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \\nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \\n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \\ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \\npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \\nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \\nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \\nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \\nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \\nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \\ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \\nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \\nand health-care providers. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \\nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \\nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \\nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \\nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \\ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \\noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \\nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \\naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \\nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \\nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \\nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \\nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \\n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \\nstudy. \\n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \\n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \\nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \\nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \\n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \\nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \\nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \\nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \\nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \\nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \\nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \\nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \\nby p values of less than 0.05. \\n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \\n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \\nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \\nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \\nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \\nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \\nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \\nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \\nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \\nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \\nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \\n(no-law states). \\n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \\nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \\nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \\ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \\n43.2%, respectively). \\n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \\nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \\nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \\nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \\n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \\nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \\nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \\nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \\nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \\ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \\n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \\nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \\nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \\nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \\nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \\n\\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \\nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \\nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \\nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \\nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \\nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \\nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \\n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \\nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \\nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \\neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \\nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \\nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \\ndirected at parents with young children. \\n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \\naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \\nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \\nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \\nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \\nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \\nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \\nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \\nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

The \\nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \\nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \\nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \\n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \\nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \\nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \\ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \\nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \\nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \\ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \\n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \\ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \\nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \\nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \\npool, or random variation. \\n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \\ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \\nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \\nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \\nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \\nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \\nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \\nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \\n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \\nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \\nA(H1N1). \\n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \\ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \\nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \\namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \\n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \\nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \\ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \\nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \\nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \\nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \\nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \\ntechnology (ART) procedures. \\n\\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \\npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \\nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \\nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \\n\\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \\nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \\nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \\nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \\nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \\ntraditional therapies. \\n\\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \\nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \\nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \\n\\no in vitro \\no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \\n  transfer \\no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \\nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \\ntowards improved success of these technologies. \\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n                           Future Areas of Research\\n\\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \\nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \\ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \\ndisease. \\n\\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \\nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \\namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \\n\\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \\nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \\nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \\nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \\nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \\nsex-linked disorders. \\n\\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \\nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \\nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \\nof affected children. \\n\\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\nUniversity of Arizona\\nTucson, Arizona\\n\\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\\n                           Management of Infertility\\n\\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \\nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \\n\\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \\nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \\nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \\nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \\nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \\nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \\nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \\nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \\nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \\nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \\nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \\nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \\nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \\negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \\nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \\nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \\n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \\ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \\nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \\nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \\ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \\nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \\n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \\ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \\nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \\nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \\novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \\nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \\nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \\nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \\ntraditional therapies. \\n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \\nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \\navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \\nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \\nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \\nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \\nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \\nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \\nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \\nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \\nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \\nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \\nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \\n\\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \\nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \\nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \\ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \\noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \\nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \\ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \\npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \\nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \\n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \\nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \\nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \\npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \\nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \\nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \\nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \\npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \\na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \\ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \\nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \\nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \\n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \\nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \\nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \\ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \\n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \\nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \\nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \\nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \\nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \\nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \\nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \\nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \\n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \\nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \\nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \\ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \\npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \\nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \\nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \\nthrough enzymatic digestion. \\n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \\npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \\nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \\nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \\nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \\nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \\noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \\nestablish conception. \\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\n--------- end of part 2 ------------\\n\\n---\\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\\n\"),\n",

I don't\\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\\n>\\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\\n\\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\\n\\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\\n\\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\\nI also passed my road test.\\n\\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\\na car and been killed.\\n\\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\\nas I did.\\n\\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\\nyou're ready to use it.\\n\\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \\n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \\n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\\n\\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\\n\\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \\n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \\n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\\n>a difference)\\n\\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\\nmore expensive.\\n\\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\\n\\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\\n\\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\\n\\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\\n\\n\\n\"),\n",

Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \\nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \\ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \\nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I\\'m going to state it again here.\\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \\nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\\n\\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \\nper day).\\n\\n\\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \\n\\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\\n\\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\\n\\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \\nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \\nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \\nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\\n\\n\\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \\n\\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\\n\\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \\n\\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\\n\\n\\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\\n\\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \\n\\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\\n\\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \\nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \\noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \\nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \\nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \\nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \\nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \\n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \\nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \\nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \\nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \\nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \\nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \\nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \\nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \\nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \\nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \\nbefore supplementation.\\n\\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \\nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don\\'t know about \\nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \\nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \\nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \\nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \\nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \\nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \\ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \\nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \\nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \\nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \\nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \\nin urinary oxalate excretion.\\n\\n\\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\\n\\n\\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\\n\\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\\n\\n\\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \\n\\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\\n\\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\\n\\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \\nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \\nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \\nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \\nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn\\'t \\nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \\nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \\nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \\n\\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \\nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \\nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \\nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \\neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \\nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \\nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \\nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \\nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \\nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \\ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \\nformation should be given B6 supplements.\\n\\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \\nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \\ncalcium-oxalate.\\n\\n\\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \\npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest.

The following letter, which represents a small portion \\nof the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical \\ndocuments, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, \\nwas sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, \\nprogram directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and \\nradio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide \\nof 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people \\nof Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the \\nlost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is \\nmourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their \\nlives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations \\nmay live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and \\nprosperously.\\n\\n------------------------- letter ----------------------------------\\n\\nDuring the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nhas planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which \\nnot only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the \\nmethod used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, \\nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \\nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \\nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\\n\\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \\nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \\nGenocide.\\n\\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \\nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\\n\\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\\n\\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\\n\\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \\nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \\nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \\nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \\nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \\ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \\nof the Turkish Genocide.\\n\\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \\ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\\n\\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \\nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \\nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \\nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\\n\\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \\nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \\n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \\ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \\narmed struggle.

It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \\nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \\ncan't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  \\napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \\nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \\nneed to re-boot.\\n\\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \\nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \\nGPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \\n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \\nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \\nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \\nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \\nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \\nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \\nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \\nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\\n\\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \\nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \\nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \\n\\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \\nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \\nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \\nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\\n\\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \\ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \\nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  \\nDark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  \\ngdi.exe.\\n\\nAny help is truly appreciated.....\\n\\n-Eric\\n\\nebosco@us.oracle.com\\n\"),\n",

If a scientist creates a unique living creature\\n#(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the\\n#right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?\\n\\nDear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions,\\nbut that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there\\nare respondents.  As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,\\nme, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)\\nin the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,\\nan earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by\\nsight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things\\nto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of\\nGod\\'s spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of\\nthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer\\'s plan, most followed\\nthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer\\'s aspirations (\"I\\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . .\" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)\\nresulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and\\nthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who\\nbecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven\\n(\"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast\\nthem to the earth . . .\" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).\\n\\nTo get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to\\nGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),\\nwe made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: \"Where wast thou\\nwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars\\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" Job 38:4-7).  We\\nlost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the \"Veil of Forgetful-\\nness,\" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.\\n\\nYou may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the\\nBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular\\naspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.\\n\\n#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so\\n#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,\\n#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?\\n#\\n#Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.\\n\\n(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd\\nas they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe\\nin the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They\\nwill cry \"heresy\" and other accusations of \"perverting\" the doctrines of\\nthe Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as\\nfound in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)\\n\\nAs for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as\\nexplained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea\\nScroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not\\nleast, modern-day revelation on the subject.\\n\\n#I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.\\n#\\n#                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that\\n#                        he is acting according to God\\'s will, and who there-\\n#     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by\\n#                        stabbing you in the back?\\n#\\n#                                                        -Voltaire\\n\\n\\nCasper C.

Armenians were involved in espionage and \\nfifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. \\nThey were promised an \\'independent\\' state under German \\'protection\\' in \\nan agreement signed by the \\'Armenian National Council.\\' (A copy of \\nthis agreement can be found in the \\'Congressional Record,\\' November 1, \\n1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians \\nwere aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed \\npro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war.\\n\\n\\nIn 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi\\nconcentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first\\nArmenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion \\nhad grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro \\n(the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the \\narchitect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds \\nbetween 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious \\nDashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged \\nby this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \\nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \\nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler\\'s policy of \\nextermination of the Jews.\\n\\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\\nexterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

The appearance that there is one\\ncomes from attempting to use a coordinate system that doesn\\'t map properly\\n(physically) in this geometry, rather analogous to the \"singularity\" at\\nthe North and South Poles of the Earth when using Latitude and Longitude\\nlines.  Such \"singular\" behavior as the earlier post suggested (infinite\\ntime to reach the horizon) is a mathematical artifact of the wrong choice\\nof coordinates.  As Paul says, in the object\\'s frame of reference,\\nit WILL hit the horizon in finite time, and then plunge to the singularity\\n(that IS a \"real\" singularity) in a (short, for \"small\" holes) further finite \\namount of time.\\n\\nNot only that, but to an OUTSIDE observer, an object that falls into a black\\nhole disappears in a finite time also, in spite of the relativistic \"slow-\\ndown\" that intuition suggests.  This is because any light emitted by the\\nobject as it falls (or is shone onto it by a separate \"flashlight\") consists\\nof individual, FINITE quanta, and only a finite number of these can reach\\nthe object before it plunges through the horizon.  These will be succesively\\nmore red-shifted, true, but only a finite number of them will hit the object,\\nand following ones will be too late to interact with the object until they,\\ntoo, are inside the horizon (and thus cannot come out).\\n\\nThis reddening, dimming and disappearance is exponentially fast, as the object \\napproaches the horizon, when you do the math.\\n\\nAs Paul says, this is discussed in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler\\'s book \\n\"Gravity\" where they talk about the appropriatness (sp?) of the term \"black \\nhole\" and the inappropriatness (sp?) of an older term: \"frozen star\", which \\nwas used earlier in this century before all the implications of black-hole \\ntheory were understood.

You\\'ve\\nposted plenty of claims, but you haven\\'t given us any valid reason to\\nbelieve that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem\\non the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I\\nfeel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments\\nhave any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you\\'ve cited involve such\\nstrange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are\\napplicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal\\nto the Supreme Court.\\n\\nWhy can\\'t you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular\\nemployee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay\\nhis income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-\\nsion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court\\nwith a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally\\nvoluntary?

When\\nthe FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don\\'t you just tell\\nthem they\\'re out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,\\nD.C., where they belong?\\n\\nOr maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you\\nsuggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.\\nIf you want to renounce society\\'s legal framework, fine; we can just\\ndeclare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads\\nwith no license plate on your car and no driver\\'s license in your wallet\\ncan just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with\\nplenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).\\n\\nSorry, everyone, it\\'s getting late, and I\\'m sick and tired of all this\\ngarbage.

Does anyone know anything about\\nthis problem........\\n\\n- I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded\\n  text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.\\n  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting\\n  truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables\\n  LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,\\n  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything\\n  works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.\\n  (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual\\n   application, just in my sample code to make things easier)\\n\\t\\n- I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up\\n  to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do   \\n  XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources\\n  are set to japanese fonts.\\n\\n- Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially\\n  created with UIL. \\n\\n\\nThe problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting\\nXmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable\\nalternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)\\n\\nI have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone\\nwants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not\\nproperly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the\\nsource to look at it is just a guess.\\n\\nPlease let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion,\\nor if you want the sample program.\\n\\nTHANKS!!!!!!!!\\n\\n- Susan \\n\\n  swalker@bbn.com\\n  617-873-8190\\n\\n\"),\n",

(I am almost\\nsure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be\\nwrong.  Oh well, I don\\'t have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don\\'t feel\\nlike thinking through it right now.)\\n \\nWhat is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,\\nis exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes\\n(acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals\\nmay form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.\\nThe reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery\\ncharger) is put back into the battery.\\n \\nLead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Each\\ncell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts\\n(terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric\\nenergy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, it\\nhas a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  So\\nwhile keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.\\n \\nTo understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on\\nconcrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier\\'s\\nPrinciple, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will\\nact to move to a more comfortable position.

Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powder\\nare on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  The thermal conductivity\\nof concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4\\ntimes greater than wood.\\n \\nIt is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on\\nconcrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant the\\ndischarge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity\\nor heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).)\\nDuring storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on\\nthe battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivity\\nsurface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity\\nsurface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom\\nsurface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature,\\nthe battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster\\nthan that on dirt.\\n \\nThis is where LeChatelier\\'s principle comes into play.  Removing energy from\\nthe exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If the\\nreaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that\\ntemperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface is\\na better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner\\nof a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which\\n\"pulls\" the reaction along.\\n \\nAlso, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric\\nacid to water.  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction.\\n \\nJeff White      jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu\\n \\n\"How do I get the ketchup out of my pocket protector?\"  French fries!\\n'),\n",

(I'm a little\\nfuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).\\n\\nIt was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in\\nSanta Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and Hal\\nJosephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. We\\ngot to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec\\n(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)\\n... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).\\n\\nNote however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.\\n\\nCompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTime\\ndoes indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated\\nabove... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size\\nthen it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). The\\nprice of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies\\noften, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick\\non the latest 040 machines.\\n\\nI'm not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM in\\nthe 3DO box. Obviously the ARM is faster, but how much?\\n\\nRob Barris\\nQuicksilver Software Inc.\\nrbarris@orion.oac.uci.edu\\n\"),\n",

Otherwise you\\'ll have\\n    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string\\n    instead of using convenient octal sequences.]\\n\\n    If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show\\n    your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you\\'ll\\n    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out\\n    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.\\n    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence\\n    in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ...\\n\\n\\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+\\n| Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\\\\\\\\\\///       |\\n+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\\\XX/ -------+\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n'),\n",

The speech to the \\npublishers is actually at 3:15 p.m.  It will be followed by Q&A.  And \\nthen after the speech and Q&A, he\\'ll attend a reception with the \\npublishers, and then return to Washington from Boston.  And that\\'s it \\nfor the weekend.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has the President seen the report from -- or the \\nletter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, \\nobviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright?  And what is \\nhis reaction to their call on him?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, obviously, the letter was written to \\nSecretary Christopher.  I believe Secretary Christopher received the \\nletter on Saturday.  He reviewed it and met with the authors on \\nMonday to discuss their views.  He believes it\\'s an important part of \\nthe policy-making process and is taking their views into account as \\nwe go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is the President\\'s reaction?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President hasn\\'t seen the letter.  It \\nwas something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher.  In \\nterms of -- he hasn\\'t seen specifically the letter, but in terms of \\ntheir concerns generally, what the President has said is that there \\nare a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren\\'t \\nthere before.  And I think he\\'s, as is everybody, gravely concerned \\nabout the situation in Bosnia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he influenced by that?  I mean, how does he feel \\nabout the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk \\nofficers --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Many of the specialists in that area -- I \\nthink that that is clearly part of the process.  It\\'s something -- \\ntheir views will clearly be considered.  I think Secretary \\nChristopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views.  I \\nthink he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that \\nthose opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who \\nwork closely on the issues.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What do you mean, there are options on the table \\nthat weren\\'t there before?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President said last week that \\nthere were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian \\nMuslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being \\nconsidered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine \\nAlbright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action \\nby the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along.  Is that on the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I can\\'t discuss anything that would -- \\nany conversations that would have happened between Ambassador \\nAlbright and the President.  But I think the President has said he \\nwould certainly -- is working with our European allies.  He\\'s had a \\nnumber of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build \\nsome consensus there.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything \\nspecific to say today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  I mean, in term of there will be no new \\nannouncement of policy today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does your statement mean he has ruled out \\nunilateral action?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He\\'s continuing to consult with our allies \\nat this point.  He has said -- I think he\\'s been fairly clear about \\nit, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with \\nits allies on this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On that point, does he believe that the U.S., \\nthough, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already \\nto take unilateral action?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes \\nit clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian \\nrelief effort.  I think the broader point is that anything we do, any \\noptions that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is \\nconsistent with U.N. authority, and if it\\'s not, we\\'ll work with our \\nallies to make sure that we get it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as \\ndistinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done \\nto stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that that\\'s why we\\'re considering \\nadditional options.  I think that Mr. Wiesel\\'s comments yesterday \\nwere quite compelling.  The situation in Bosnia is tragic.  The \\nPresident is very concerned about it.  He has -- I think President \\nClinton has worked very hard  to take further actions to continue to \\nisolate Serbia in the world community.  Clearly, we\\'re considering \\nother options because the President is concerned that perhaps it\\'s \\nnot enough.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of what you were just talking about, it \\nsounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to \\nprotect humanitarian --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t think it -- I wouldn\\'t use the word \\njustify.  It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting \\nthe delivery of humanitarian relief.  But I think that\\'s just an \\nexplanation of the resolution.  I think any action that we take will \\nbe consistent with U.N. resolutions or we\\'ll work with our allies to \\nmake sure that it is permissible or we\\'ll get further action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The President and other officials have ruled out \\nunilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past.  You\\'re declining to do \\nthat this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I said the President has said repeatedly \\nthat he wants to act in concert with our allies on this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That doesn\\'t mean that he won\\'t act alone, which \\nhas been said before explicitly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t mean to imply a change in policy.  \\nThe President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with \\nour allies on this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One other little question.  Did he know about this \\nletter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe so.  Secretary Christopher \\n-- they may have had a private conversation about it.  The President \\nhas not seen it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  They met on Monday, right?  Christopher met --\\nsurely, he must have brought that up --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, they may have talked privately about \\nit, but --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, what you\\'re saying is that the Albright \\nrecommendation has been rejected, is that correct?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I didn\\'t say that at all.  I said I \\nwon\\'t -- I said I wouldn\\'t comment on any conversations or \\ncommunications.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  She\\'s advocating unilateral action and you\\'re \\nsaying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I am not confirming anything that Madeleine \\nAlbright may or may not have recommended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and \\nfrustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, \\ndoes the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service \\nofficers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to \\nthat?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that their views are obviously being \\nconsidered.  The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two \\ndays later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing \\nof their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater \\ndetail the options that they had presented in the letter.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Doesn\\'t it put some kind of pressure on --\\nadditional pressure on him now from within his own administration to \\nact regardless of what the allies may or may not do?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think clearly there\\'s a broad policy \\nreview underway now.  And the President and his advisors are \\nconsidering a number of options, including some of those outlined in \\nthe letter from the folks over at the State Department.  Now, no \\ndecisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a \\nthrough review underway, and that their opinions are being very \\nseriously considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I can just follow up, I guess what I\\'m looking \\nfor is what was his reaction to this letter?  Did he say, good, this \\nbolsters my position?  Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don\\'t \\nneed right now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he said this helps contribute \\nsubstantively to the debate.  It\\'s important that all views be \\nconsidered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he \\nwants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and \\nthis, I think in many ways, furthers that goal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the \\nPresident -- it\\'s all open now, and you wouldn\\'t take any umbrage or \\nsay that they were out of line?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the fact that Secretary \\nChristopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they \\nhad an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is \\nconclusive evidence that their views are welcome.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does the policy review include what Madeleine \\nAlbright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested, \\nwhich is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral \\naction -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The unilateral option is on the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We\\'ve had two different --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t that a change, Dee Dee?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That would be a change of policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Particularly if it includes ground troops, which \\nhas been specifically ruled out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has been -- well, no.  \\nI don\\'t -- that is not --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you talking about all options?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  All options -- I think the President has \\nbeen fairly clear about that.  So let me just review again what he \\nhas said.  He has said that -- the President has said all options are \\non the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground \\ntroops, which he has never suggested.  He has ruled that out from the \\nbeginning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Hasn\\'t he ruled out unilateral action of any sort?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He has said that he doesn\\'t believe the U.S. \\ncan solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself.  I think \\nthat there are a number of very complicated options on the table \\nright now.  I don\\'t think that -- again, I don\\'t want to comment on \\nspecific options that are being considered other than in the broad \\ncategories that we\\'ve already said -- things like lifting the arms \\nembargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we\\'ve talked \\nabout in broad terms.  This is a very complicated situation.  The \\noptions being presented and considered are very complicated.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Air strikes on the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I think that\\'s been fairly clearly \\npointed out that that\\'s something that\\'s being discussed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, are ground troops on the -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, ground troops are not being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said there was not going to be -- you said you \\nwere not announcing a change of policy.  Then you said everything is \\non the table.  We\\'re confused.  Are unilateral actions on the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  All I can tell you is what the President has \\nsaid -- that he doesn\\'t believe -- that he wants to act in concert \\nwith the allies on this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Wants to, but he\\'s willing to -- I mean, if they \\ndon\\'t go along --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He\\'s continuing to consult with our allies \\non this.  He\\'s continuing to have discussions.  He\\'s continuing to \\npress them for further action.  And I think that\\'s clear.  The \\nconversation is ongoing.  We\\'re going to continue to work with them \\nto find the best possible solution and next step on this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to \\nconduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite \\neffect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel \\nthat their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid \\nwould become vulnerable and the Bosnians --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not sure that\\'s the consistent -- I \\nmean, I\\'m not sure who you\\'re referring to.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The British and the French.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, the British and French.  They\\'ve taken the \\nposition that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized \\nby any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military.  Does the \\nU.S. believe differently from that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had conversations with \\nboth Mitterrand and Major, as you know.  I think that there is a \\nthorough review of policy going on in those countries as well.  And I \\ndon\\'t want to comment on the nature of the President\\'s discussions \\nother than to say that he\\'s continuing to consult with our allies as \\nwe move forward and he\\'s continuing to press them for further action.  \\nAnd I think that process is ongoing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     the other day voted against any military \\nintervention yesterday.  Does the President regard that as the end of \\nthe line or does he does still hold out some possibility of \\nunilateral action?  The allies have been very, very plain that they \\ndo not want to do anything.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The consultations are ongoing.  That\\'s all I \\ncan tell you at this point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you saying that there won\\'t be any announcement \\non Bosnia today in the press conference?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, that is not the intention of the press \\nconference.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is the intention?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s an opportunity to take questions.  He \\nmay have a brief -- I\\'m sure he\\'ll have a brief opening statement, \\nbut it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia.  That \\nwill not happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us what the subject of the opening \\nstatement is?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s sort of a general statement of where we \\nare.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  After the first hundred days, you mean?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s not a long statement.  I mean, this is \\njust generally.  Don\\'t look for any major policy pronouncements.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know what the opening statement is?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  But it\\'s -- perhaps later today I\\'ll be able \\nto tell you with more certainty -- I think that\\'s still under review.  \\nBut the overriding purpose of this -- it\\'s not a mystery; it\\'s not \\nmeant to be.  It\\'s just to take questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It would be helpful to know whether -- what the \\nopening statement is on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Since the major purpose here is just to take \\nquestions, it\\'s not completely resolved yet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and \\nthat the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get, \\nwould be an AIDS czar.  Will he announce that today?  And what\\'s the \\ndelay on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t think we meant to imply -- I think \\nwe said it would happen soon.  I don\\'t think we meant to imply with \\nany certainty that it would be this week.  It is coming soon.  I \\ndon\\'t anticipate that happening today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the delay?  Isn\\'t this the perfect time to \\nannounce an AIDS czar?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know that it\\'s a delay.  I think the \\nprocess is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through \\nthe necessary background checks, and to make sure that we\\'ve crossed \\nthe t\\'s and dotted the i\\'s before we make an announcement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird\\'s qualifications for \\nthe Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?  And why wasn\\'t her \\nappointment announced here?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The qualifications -- I don\\'t know if \\nthere\\'s a specific list; I\\'ll have to check and see.  I think there \\nare a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds.  \\nMany of them have long histories in intelligence or other government \\nservice.  I think there\\'s a broad variety of views across political \\nspectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there.  We never \\nmade a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board, \\nwhich is Admiral William Crowe.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why would he appoint her, though, if the American \\npeople and many in the Senate rejected her for another government \\njob?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe that the American people \\never had -- voted on her.  And I certainly -- she was never rejected \\nin the Senate.  She never went up there for a hearing.  But the \\nPresident believes she\\'s a very competent person.  He\\'s said that -- \\nZoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is?  Zoe Baird is on \\nthe President\\'s Foreign Intelligence --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said she never went up there for a hearing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage \\nover violating federal laws?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Right, she never -- she was never -- but you \\nsaid she was rejected by the Senate.  I was just simply trying to \\npoint out that she was never voted on by the Senate.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So you don\\'t think that is any problem?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t think there\\'s any problem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  She has been appointed to this board, is that a \\nfact?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does she need confirmation for this?  Does she need \\nconfirmation to be a member of the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  It\\'s a presidential appointment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Usually, announcements are made here at the White \\nHouse.  Was there a decision not to announce her publicly?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We didn\\'t make an announcement.  People who \\nasked were told who  the members of the board were.  We didn\\'t make \\nan official announcement.  If anybody\\'s interested in that we can \\ncertainly put out the list of names.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'d like to know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Don\\'t such board members -- don\\'t you normally as a  \\nmatter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and \\npresidential appointment regardless of their dimension?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Not always.  But, again, I\\'m happy to put \\nthis out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t that the standard practice?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That was past practice.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I\\'m happy to put it out.  We\\'ll put \\nout a list of the members of the board today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, I don\\'t want to try to fail to let you get \\nout of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is \\nhasn\\'t it been the practice in this administration for such \\nannouncements to be made routinely?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think generally but not always.  And we\\'re \\nhappy to put that out today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is the board, what is her title, what is the \\nsize of the board?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There is roughly a dozen members on the \\nboard.  It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, \\nretired military personnel on the board that provide input into \\nintelligence policy for the President.  Again, the chairman of that \\nboard is Admiral William Crowe.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And did he recommend Baird?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the name of the board?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s the President\\'s Foreign Intelligence \\nAdvisory Board, PFIAB.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s her qualification -- that she had employed \\nan illegal alien?  Is that -- (laughter) -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Do you want an answer to the question or you \\njust want to make a joke?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let me phrase it another way.  Why shouldn\\'t this \\nappointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a \\ncouple of months ago?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Because it\\'s not.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s her experience in foreign intelligence?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  She\\'s an experienced attorney, someone who \\nthe President believes is very competent and qualified.  And I think \\npart of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input.  Not \\neverybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that \\nis not the board\\'s mission.  It is to provide civilian input for the \\nPresident as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters.  He \\nbelieves she\\'s very qualified, very competent person, enormously \\ntalented and has said that throughout.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this just a figment of my overactive \\nimagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the \\nPresident\\'s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t think so.  On December 24th, when he \\nannounced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he \\nwould -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board.  So I \\ndon\\'t believe there\\'s ever been any --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Earlier than that, during the transition.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I don\\'t believe so.  It was announced, \\nagain, on December 24th.  Admiral Crowe couldn\\'t be there, but it was \\nannounced. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are members paid?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe so, but I\\'ll double-check.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the \\ndiscrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the \\nbodies that are coming out of Waco and the state?  I guess it\\'s the \\nTexas Ranger reports.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Most of the information is coming -- the \\nfederal information is coming from the site.  Clearly, there\\'s been \\nsome discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it.  \\nOfficials in the Justice Department were told, I believe the day \\nbefore yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet \\nholes.  I think there\\'s some discrepancy about that, and the Justice \\nDepartment is looking into it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President going to get involved in trying to \\nsort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down \\nthere, with some people withdrawing, others saying they\\'re in charge, \\nbut others -- Justice, FBI, Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of \\nthis?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know that he\\'s going to try to \\nmediate the dispute.  I mean, I\\'ll let you know if there\\'s anything \\nhe intends to do about it.  But as you know, there are several levels \\nof investigation ongoing, and we\\'re hopeful that they can work \\ntogether. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there any one agency or official down there in \\ncharge of everything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know.  I\\'ll have to get back to you \\non that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is the subject matter of Sunday\\'s speech?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s going to be fairly general.  I don\\'t \\nthink it\\'s going to be any specific announcements.  I think it\\'s \\ngoing to be sort of a --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he have a topic that he\\'s going to talk about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'re still working on it.  But I wouldn\\'t \\nlook for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of \"my \\nexcellent adventure for 100 days\"?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Not exactly, but I think he\\'ll take a little \\nbit broader look about what\\'s happened in the last --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Foreign, domestic?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  A little bit of both, but I think a lot of \\ndomestic.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And overview. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, more of an overview than a specific \\npolicy announcement.  \\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which \\nthe President will address the gay rights march on Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It will be a letter read to the crowd by \\nCongresswoman Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that available?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Not yet, but it will be.  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you going to put it out here or --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'ll probably put it out here on Sunday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Travel next week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Unclear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Likely?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Likely?  Possible?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Possible.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s possible?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Travel.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform \\nand national service legislative proposals next week.  Do you have \\ndays yet for them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Not yet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us which order?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Campaign finance reform first; national \\nservice later in the week.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And any report in the aftermath of the day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Any readout from the day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Readout.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s possible.  Jeff Eller will be down \\nthere.  I think he can go through what the President did during the \\nday.  We don\\'t expect any photo op or anything, other than departure \\nhere in the morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   Dee Dee, the President has not made a regular \\npractice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to Camp David.  \\nIn fact, he\\'s been there -- what -- once or twice?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Twice.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why this weekend?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He went two weekends ago, as you know, on \\nthe way home from his father-in-law\\'s funeral.  I think that they \\nfound it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend \\nsome time together as a family.  And this is just an opportunity to \\ndo the same.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There\\'s no march there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It has nothing to do with the march here?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since he\\'s going to be in town Sunday morning now \\ninstead of in Jamestown, have you thought about him making a quick \\npass-by, fly-over -- (laughter) --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He\\'ll fly straight to Boston.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Flying straight did you say?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George took a question yesterday on Waco.

The transformer is just that - a \\ntransformer.  It\\'s there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although\\nthe inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT\\nnegligible, as anyone who\\'s zapped said transistor from either failing to\\nget one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a\\n\"snubber\" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended\\nfor switcher use today have the diode built in.)\\n\\nThe basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in\\na somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a\\nhigh voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or\\n\"filter\") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.\\nThe transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,\\nresulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which \\nare then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer\\'s outputs\\nis sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,\\nwhich acts in a \"pulse-width modulation\" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying\\nthe pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and\\ntherefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs\\nmay be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less\\ntracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear\\nregulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the \\nregulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)\\nis not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various\\nsafety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be\\nelectrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator\\nto meet this requirement.\\n\\nWhile the transformer isn\\'t the primary energy-storage device in these\\ndesigns, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can\\nbe ignored; besides the inductive \"kick\" giving the switch transistor a\\nbad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the\\nenergy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.\\nIn some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,\\nyou need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn\\'t\\nsaturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the \\nimagination! :-)).\\n\\nI\\'m NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; \\nhopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors\\nin the above.\\n\\n\\nBob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not\\n                   Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any other\\nmyers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.\\n'),\n",

According\\n-> > to the Federalist Paper\\'s, a well regulated militia has a well defined \\n-> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.\\n-> \\n-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\\n\\nPerhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the\\n\"well regulated malitia.\"  Here is what is says about its character:\\n\\n\\t To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\\n\\t of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\\n\\t military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\\n\\t acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\\n\\t character of a well-regulated militia, \\n\\nIt also talks about the \"well regulated militia\" having a nationally\\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \\n\\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\\n\\n    \\tLittle more can reasonably be aimed at, with\\n\\trespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\\n\\tand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\\n\\twill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\\n\\ta year.\\n\\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \\nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \\n\\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \\na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \\n\\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\\n\\n\\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \\n\\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \\n\\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \\n\\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \\n\\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \\n\\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \\n\\tNational Guard.\\n\\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \\nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\\n\\n\\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \\n\\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \\n\\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \\n\\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \\n\\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \\n\\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\\n\\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \\n\\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\\n\\n\\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \\n\\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\\n\\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\\n\\trecital of particulars.\"\\n\\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \\nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \\nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \\nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\\n\\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\\n\\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \\n\\t   this puzzle\"\\n\\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\\n\\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for\\' justify:\\n\\t   explain an error\\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\\nfor \"qualify\" is:\\n\\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\\n\\t   of; characterize.\\n\\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \\n\\t   task.\\n\\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\\n\\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\\n\\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\\n\\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \\nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \\nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \\n\\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \\nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \\npeople\\'s right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \\nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\\nme.\\n\\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\\n\\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?  I \\nforce my version of \"our Liberties and Rights\" by begining statements\\nof what \"our Liberties and Rights\" with \"All that the Second Amendment \\nclearly states to me.\"   Using expressions, such as \"states to me,\" \\nclearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nSo in effort not to force my views and not \"to destory our Liberties and\\nRights,\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\\nthe matter of \"Liberties and Rights\" is the final word.

In my\\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\\nTheir way is the \\'truth.\\'\\n\\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\\nbut it seems to me a choice.\\n\\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\\n\\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I\\'d ask, \"How do\\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\\nyou\\'re daddy is right?\"  \"He says he\\'s always right!\"\\n\\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\\naren\\'t we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\\nfalse?\\n\\n-------------\\n\\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I\\napologize if I\\'m covering tired old ground.  Some of the\\ndiscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome\\nany comments.\\n\\n| Louis J.

I\\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there\\'s not enough\\nevidence to believe it, or that there\\'s just as good evidence for\\nother religions.  I don\\'t agree, but clearly there are plenty of\\nintelligent people who don\\'t find the evidence convincing.  But that\\ndoesn\\'t seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\\nit are false.\\n\\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that\\'s rather different than\\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\\npeople choose what value to follow, but there\\'s no actual independent\\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it\\'s\\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn\\'t).  The\\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\\nexternal reality.  I hope we\\'re all honest enough not to claim that we\\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don\\'t\\nsee how else we could proceed.\\n\\nThis needn\\'t result in arrogance.  I\\'m certainly interested in talking\\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\\neven if they don\\'t, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it\\'s\\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.\\n\\n--clh]\\n'),\n",

In short, I am happy\\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\" Magnavox went away.  It\\nisn\\'t as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\\n\\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn\\'t support them).  The Hercules Graphite\\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn\\'t run the same test cases as\\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier\\'s Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\\n\\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\\nlisted plus \\'Generic\\', and if you choose Generic you can\\'t get any high\\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\\n\\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don\\'t know what I have) he was unable\\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn\\'t have\\nthe problem.  He didn\\'t know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\\n\\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\\nin pixels/second.  I don\\'t have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren\\'t really comparable.  The following numbers\\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\\n\\n\\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\\n\\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M\\n\\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics\\noperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two\\nnumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.\\nWhen the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --\\n1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds\\nlike programming to a benchmark to me....\\n\\nI make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what\\nI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don\\'t write disclaimers,\\nbut this time maybe I\\'d better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my\\nwork (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the\\nknowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.\\n\\ngeoff sherwood\\n'),\n",

I am \\nusing X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be \\nworking with Open Look in the future.\\n\\n     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the \\nuser from switching from one window of the application to \\nanother window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top \\nof Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks \\nthe mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the \\nwindow hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain \\ncircumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to \\nbeep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window \\nA.\\n\\n      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that \\nthis window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this \\ncase Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default \\nprocessing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell \\nwhen this switching occurs through focus change and mapping \\nnotify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the \\nswitch.\\n\\n      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very \\nkludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch \\nin those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force \\nthe formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call \\nand beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary \\nfunctionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places \\ntwice.\\n\\n      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* \\nwindow manager) when I don't want the window order switch to \\nactually take place?

McElwaine, Physicist\\n          \\n               Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody \"knew\" that a \\n          heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly.  It would \\n          violate the \"laws\" of physics.  All of the \"experts\" and \\n          \"authorities\" said so. \\n          \\n               For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  \"The \\n          demonstration that no possible combination of known \\n          substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of \\n          force, can be united in a practical machine by which man \\n          shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer \\n          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any \\n          physical fact to be.\" \\n          \\n               Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright \\n          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final \\n          word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they \\n          crash). \\n          \\n               Today, orthodox physicists and other \"scientists\" are \\n          saying similar things against several kinds of \\'Free Energy\\' \\n          Technologies, using negative terms such as \"pseudo-science\" \\n          and \"perpetual motion\", and citing so-called \"laws\" which \\n          assert that \"energy cannot be created or destroyed\" (\"1st law \\n          of thermodynamics\") and \"there is always a decrease in useful \\n          energy\" (\"2nd law of thermodynamics\").  The physicists do not \\n          know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare \\n          that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF \\n          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern \"science\" and help to \\n          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox \\n          modern theories. \\n          \\n               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a \\n          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-\\n          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT \\n          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated \\n          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. \\n          \\n               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, \\n          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by \\n          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, \\n          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they \\n          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy \\n          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by \\n          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced \\n          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and \\n          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and \\n          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are \\n          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly \\n          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. \\n          \\n               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, \\n          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for \\n          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly \\n          tapping into energy circulating through the earth\\'s magnetic \\n          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to \\n          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in \\n          \"Science & Mechanics\" magazine, Spring 1980, (\"Amazing \\n          Magnet-Powered Motor\", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, \\n          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, \\n          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such \\n          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible \\n          heatpump in one\\'s home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.  [Complete \\n          descriptive copies of U.S. patents are $3.00 each from the \\n          U.S. Patent Office, 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA  \\n          22202; correct 7-digit patent number required.  Or try \\n          getting copies of BOTH the article AND the Patents via your \\n          local public or university library\\'s inter-library loan \\n          dept..] \\n          \\n               A second type of free-energy device, such as the \\'Gray \\n          Motor\\' (U.S. Patent #3,890,548), the \\'Tesla Coil\\', and the \\n          motor of inventor Joseph Newman [see SCIENCE, 2-10-84, pages \\n          571-2.], taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from \\n          \\'EARTH RESONANCE\\' (about 12 cycles per second plus \\n          harmonics).  They typically have a \\'SPARK GAP\\' in the circuit \\n          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the \\n          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total \\n          \\'inductance\\' and \\'capacitance\\' of the Device combine to \\n          \\'RESONATE\\' at the same frequency as \\'EARTH RESONANCE\\' in \\n          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be \\n          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the \\'NEUTRAL CENTER\\' \\n          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a \\n          Tesla Coil, slipping a \\'TOROID CHOKE COIL\\' around the \\n          secondary coil will enhance output power.  [\"Earth Energy: \\n          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems\", by John Bigelow, 1976, \\n          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] \\n          \\n               During the 1930\\'s, an Austrian civil engineer named \\n          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an \\n          \\'IMPLOSION TURBINE\\' (German name, \\'ZOKWENDLE\\'), after \\n          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped \\n          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical \\n          equations to explain it.  As described in the book \"A \\n          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources\", by Dan A. Davidson, \\n          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a \\n          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a \\n          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer \\n          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, \\n          which then converts the pump\\'s motor into an ELECTRIC \\n          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that \\n          of the earth\\'s rotation, via the \\'Coriolis effect\\', LIKE A \\n          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] \\n          \\n               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the \\'McClintock \\n          Air Motor\\' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between \\n          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression \\n          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and \\n          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running \\n          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also \\n          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat \\n          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large \\n          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  \\n          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the \\n          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] \\n          \\n               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown \\n          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between \\n          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of \\n          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a \\n          common household smoke detector. \\n          \\n               One other energy source should be mentioned here, \\n          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free \\n          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph \\n          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION \\n          reactor which he calls \\'Migma\\', which uses NON-radioactive \\n          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities \\n          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be \\n          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting \\n          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power \\n          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the \\n          \"Tokamaks\" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, \\n          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power \\n          for every watt put in.  [\"New Times\" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, \\n          pages 32-40.] \\n          \\n               And then there are the \\'cold fusion\\' experiments that \\n          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by \\n          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin \\n          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake \\n          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of \\n          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the \\n          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with \\n          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which \\n          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough \\n          of it to explain the excess heat generated. \\n          \\n               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called \"laws\" \\n          of thermodynamics are NOT so \"absolute\".  For example, the \\n          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \\'Reciprocal System\\', (which he describes in detail \\n          in several books such as \"Nothing But Motion\" (1979) and \"The \\n          Universe of Motion\" (1984)), in which the physical universe \\n          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter \\n          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing \\n          between them, with-OUT the \"heat death\" predicted by \\n          thermodynamic \"laws\".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH \\n          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena \\n          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some \\n          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, \\n          seemingly converting \"low-quality energy\" into \"high-quality \\n          energy\". \\n          \\n               Also, certain religious organizations such as \\'Sant Mat\\' \\n          and \\'Eckankar\\' teach their Members that the physical universe \\n          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of \\n          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV \\n          channels, as described in books like \"The Path of the \\n          Masters\", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and \"Eckankar: The Key \\n          to Secret Worlds\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, \\n          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly \\n          called the \\'Astral Plane\\'.  Long-time Members of these groups \\n          have learned to \\'Soul Travel\\' into these higher worlds and \\n          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy \\n          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical \\n          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given \\n          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is \\n          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled \\n          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as \\n          those described in the book \"Psychic Discoveries Behind the \\n          Iron Curtain\". \\n          \\n               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors \\n          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop \\n          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional \\n          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their \\n          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If \\n          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of \\n          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and \\n          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and \\n          pollution and its harmful effects (including the \\'GREENHOUSE \\n          EFFECT\\', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil \\n          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue \\n          to increase. \\n          \\n               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development \\n          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize \\n          private production (until the producers can make it on their \\n          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of \\n          Free Energy Hardware. \\n          \\n               The long-range effects of such government intervention \\n          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy \\n          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining \\n          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, \\n          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to \\n          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, \\n          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for \\n          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, \\n          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high \\n          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR\\'s, \\n          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that \\n          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, \\n          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be \\n          able to realize the \"opportunity costs\" of paying electric \\n          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would \\n          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to \\n          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government \\n          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be \\n          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE \\n          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. \\n          \\n               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of \\n          business, but society as a whole, and the earth\\'s environment \\n          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People, \\n          that government should serve, rather than the big \\n          corporation$ and bank$. \\n          \\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (patents, articles, books). \\n\\n          \\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n\\n                                   Robert E.

The\\narmy \\nsaid no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain \\nguerrillas was not immediately known.\\n---\\n  Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu\\nNidal \\nbattled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled \\ngrenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said.\\n---\\n Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had \\nuncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said\\npro-\\nIranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.\\n  \\n     Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the\\ncatacomb-\\nlike alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village, \\nKawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles\\nsouth of \\nBeirut.\\n  \\n     The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt.

These matters\\nwill be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law\\nentitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.

Our local retailer apparently put one of these\\ntogether, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn\\'t run at 50MHz - surprise\\nsurprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I\\'m surprised that they even\\nhave a 50MHz local bus running...\\n\\nI have a choice now between basically the above system but with a\\n486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus\\nthe non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind\\nthat I\\'m primarily interested in the last two tasks?  \\n\\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any \\nspeedy help would be appreciated even more!!)\\n\\n\\n\\nBTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following \\nconfiguration:\\n\\n\\t486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram\\n\\tATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram\\n\\t14\" monitor, 1024x768 NI\\n\\tSMC Ethercard 8 bit\\n\\tMaxtor 120MB IDE hard drive\\n\\nWe\\'re quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!\\n~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or\\nbeen uncovered!  \\n\\nThere doesn\\'t seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish\\nrunning the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take\\na long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).\\n\\nThere\\'s not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive\\ndon\\'t leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with\\nmedium size images.\\n\\nI have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This\\nmachine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec \\non the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases\\ntransfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large \\nimages).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it\\nmake a difference?  I\\'m hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice \\n(above), for that reason.\\n\\nAlso, are there DX2-100\\'s on the horizon?  What about DX3-99\\'s?  DX3-150\\'s ???!\\n\\nAny information is greatly appreciated.\\n\\n-----\\nRoss Mitchell, Imaging Research Lab, |   rmitch@irus.rri.uwo.ca\\nJohn P. Robarts Research Institute   |\\nP.O.

Don\\'t forget that Jesus was seen by both\\nthe Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker.

Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a \\nman well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn\\'t know where He was\\nburied begs the question.\\n\\nNow, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on\\nthis a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a \\ndeliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I\\'m\\nnot talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth, \\nbut unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I\\'m talking about\\ndying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to\\nbe a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the \\nbody seems rather lightweight to me.\\n\\nAs for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over \\nthe body of Jesus? He wasn\\'t buried with great riches. So, again, this is\\nan argument that can be discounted.\\n\\nThat leaves you back on square one.

EDT\\n\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Please be seated.  I \\nwant to say, first, how delighted I am to be here with Secretary \\nRiley and with Senator Graham.  The three of us served as governors \\ntogether during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to \\nimprove our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to \\nupgrade the standards in American education and to improve the \\nquality of instruction our children were receiving.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There were no two governors whom I admired more during \\nthat period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher \\nof the Year.  And I think both of them would join me in saying that, \\nafter all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been \\npassed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes \\ndown to what happens between the teacher and the students in the \\nclassroom.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     That's why today's ceremony honoring the National \\nTeacher of the Year is so important.  Tracey Leon Bailey is one \\nrecognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative \\nscience programs.  He's developed and introduced into Florida's \\nclassrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA \\nfingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I \\nmight add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's \\nCapital.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Within three years of being hired by a satellite high \\nschool, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science \\nprograms in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national \\nand international awards.  These advanced programs aren't just for a \\nfavored few.  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, \\nincluding those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach \\nfor excellence and to attain it.  This is what our students need and \\nwhat our country needs. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Today, we know that a good future with high wages and \\nrich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a \\nlifetime.  The basics aren't enough anymore.  All our kids need \\ncompetence in math and science and advanced problem-solving.  That's \\nwhy Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so \\npleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these \\naccomplishments. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Tracey, you represent the best in the United States.  \\nI'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this \\nApple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. BAILEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It is indeed a \\ngreat honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's \\n2.5 million teachers.  And we appreciate the support that you have \\nshown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to \\nhelp redesign and improve our nation's schools.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We know that the quality of our children's education \\nwill directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape \\nin the years to come.  And we thank you so much for your continued \\nsupport and commitment to our children's education.  Thank you again.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  In closing, I would like to also welcome \\nthe education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the \\nnational education groups who have also come.  I'd like to recognize \\nTracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself \\na great advocate of education.  And I'd like to remind all of you \\nthat the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award \\nis to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to \\npeople all across this country who give their lives to our children, \\nall of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their \\nbest to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of \\nAmerica.  They are, in so many ways, our most important public \\nservants.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n                                 END1:29 P.M.

I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus\\n> confused \"kleros\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of\\n> land discussed.  In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\\n> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\\n\\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHenry Ward Beecher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmerican Clergyman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas recorded by George Seldes\\n'),\n",

IMHO the wider meaning is not\\n:  obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to\\n:  be!  [....]\\n\\n:  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody\\n:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very\\n:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know\\n:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]\\n\\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, \\'hacker\\'\\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, know what \\'hacker\\' means from those who consider\\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from \"Jargon File 2.9.10\".\\n(This is also known as the \"Hackers Dictionary\".)  The definitions are\\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\\n\\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in \\'a UNIX\\n     hacker\\'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence \\'password\\n     hacker\\', \\'network hacker\\'.  See {cracker}.\\n\\n     The term \\'hacker\\' also tends to connote membership in the global\\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\\n\\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\\n     you claim to be one and are not, you\\'ll quickly be labeled\\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\\n\\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\\n\\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\\n     project.\\n\\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\\n     see themselves as `benign\\' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\\n\\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\\n     hackerdom\\'s most valuable intangible asset.\\n\\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\\n: says \"Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate...\" :-)\\n\\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of \\'hacker\\'.  So,\\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\\nworkplace.  (This means that \\'hacker\\' is defined in terms of some well-known\\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\\n\\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn\\'t work that way.\\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\\n\\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is\\nto communicate.

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\\nopening and closing of the path.\\n\\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\\nthe audio.\\n\\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\\nimpedance.\\n\\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\\n\\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven\\'t seen any of these for years.\\n\\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\\n\\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and\\nyou have a mixer!\\n\\nLots of luck!\\n-- \\n73, Tom\\n================================================================================\\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

What \\nwas he killed for. He hadn\\'t hurt anyone, hadn\\'t said any word he oughtn\\'t \\nhave. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from \\nthe government--why my husband was killed.\\n\\nOn the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.\\nHe doesn\\'t work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \"Mamma, is \\nthere a soccer game?\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That\\'s where we \\nlived. I say, \"I don\\'t know, Igor, I haven\\'t turned on the TV.\" He looked \\nagain and said, \"Mamma, what\\'s going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so \\nmany people, it\\'s awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \\nyou can\\'t even tell how many there are. They\\'re shouting, \"Down with the \\nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is \\nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \\nunexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,\\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he\\'s \\naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \\ncan\\'t make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \\n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \\npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \\nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \\nAnd my son says, \"Those aren\\'t women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \\ndidn\\'t look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \\nsimply couldn\\'t sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \\nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what\\'s going on, what \\nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know what \\nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \\neach second or third one had a white rod. They\\'re waving the rods above their \\nheads as they walk, and the one who\\'s out front, like a leader, he has a white\\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \\ndon\\'t know.\\n\\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \\ndear, I\\'m frightened, they\\'re going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \\nyou afraid of, they\\'re just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \\nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \\nVocational School. \"Don\\'t fear,\" he said, \"it\\'s nothing, nothing all that \\nbad.\" He didn\\'t eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \\nWhen I heard that I couldn\\'t settle down at all, I kept walking here and \\nthere and I said, \"They\\'re going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \\nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \\nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they\\'re shouting\\ndifferent things, and you couldn\\'t hear every well. I say, \"You speak\\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they\\'re saying.\" He says \"Close the window\\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \\nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it\\'s\\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he\\'s sick, and all of this was\\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I\\'m going to go to bed in a minute\\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \\nThings had calmed down slightly.\\n\\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \\nget up.\" I say, \"Today\\'s my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren\\'t you going \\nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \\nyou going?\" He says, \"I\\'m going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \\noutside on a day like today? Don\\'t go out, for God\\'s sake. You never listen to\\nme, I know, and you\\'re not going to listen to me now, but at least don\\'t take \\nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \\nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn\\'t make it\\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\\n\\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o\\'clock in the after-\\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don\\'t be afraid, they\\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.\\'\\' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\\nit was four o\\'clock, five o\\'clock . . . and when he wasn\\'t home at seven I\\nsaid, \"Oh, they\\'ve killed Shagen!\"\\n\\nTires are burning in town, there\\'s black smoke in town, and I\\'m afraid, I\\'m \\nstanding on the balcony and I\\'m all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \\nthey\\'ve probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \\no\\'clock and he still hadn\\'t come home. And I\\'m afraid to go out. At ten\\no\\'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \\nI\\'m looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \\ndon\\'t want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn\\'t want me to see \\nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\\n\"look what they\\'re doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \\nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \\non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \\nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \\nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \\ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \\non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \\nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \\ninside, go inside! Instead why don\\'t you tell us if they are any of them in \\nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn\\'t say Armenians, \\nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They\\'ve killed\\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won\\'t be living for me without \\nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \\ngo to Khalida\\'s, and give me the key. When they come I\\'ll say that it\\'s my \\ndaughter\\'s apartment, that they\\'re off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \\nand went to the neighbor\\'s, but I couldn\\'t endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \\nhere, I\\'m going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa\\'s . . . Papa\\'s there.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \\nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \\nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they\\'re shouting, howling, \\nand I didn\\'t think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \\nUncle Shagen\\'s gone, let\\'s go see, maybe he\\'s dead in the garage or near the \\ngarage, let\\'s at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \\nEmma, where do you think you\\'re going?! Go back into the house, I\\'ll look for \\nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \\nI\\'m coming too.\" Well he wouldn\\'t let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \\nhere with us, I\\'m go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \\nEmma, there\\'s no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \\nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they\\'re already killed Alik, and Valery\\'s \\nthere . . . wheezing.\"\\n\\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don\\'t go near him, \\nor we\\'ll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he\\'s young--and came back and \\nsaid, \"I\\'m going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \\nAlik, maybe he\\'ll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \\nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \\ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\\n\\nI went upstairs to the neighbor\\'s. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \\nthere, their headlights are on, but they\\'re not touching them, they are still \\nlying where they were, they\\'re still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\\nwindow until four o\\'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn\\'t\\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\\no\\'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don\\'t\\ngo out, don\\'t go anywhere, I\\'m going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\\nalive . . . let me go . . . I\\'ve got the keys from work.\"\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \\ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \\nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \\nwanted to go in, but he wouldn\\'t let me. There were only four people in there,\\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn\\'t let me in. They\\nsaid, \"Shagen\\'s not here, he\\'s alive somewhere, he\\'ll come back.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s already seven o\\'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they\\'ve\\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it\\'s a younger person.\" Now Shagen \\njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \\nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they\\'ve \\nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \\ndead . . . he\\'s alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \\nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \\nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it\\'s not he, it\\'s somebody else entirely.\" \\nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I\\'ll find out all the same anyway, \\nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \\ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \\ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn\\'t Shagen. A few minutes \\nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \\nlike that there was no hope left.\\n\\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \\npeople.\\n\\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa\\'s been killed.\"\\n\\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \\nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \\nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \\nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \\nyes, that\\'s our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor\\'s office\\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen\\'s been taken to Baku.\\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We\\'re taking care of all that,\\ndon\\'t you worry, we\\'ll do everything, we\\'ll tell you about it. Where did you\\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\\nsays, \"You can\\'t stay home, we\\'re getting an ambulance right now, wait just\\none second, the head doctor is coming, we\\'re arranging an ambulance right\\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\\nlike a patient, and you\\'ll stay here and we\\'ll se~ later what to do next ...\"\\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor\\'s name is Izyat Jamalogli\\nSadukhov.\\n\\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \\npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \\nhospital until the 4th.\\n\\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let\\'s go.\" And the women, our \\ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \\nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They\\'re going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we\\'re going to make a positive\\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\\nstill can\\'t remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let\\'s \\ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it\\'s not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can\\'t look, no.\"\\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I\\'ll recognize them.\" He says, \\n\"Isn\\'t they\\'re anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \\nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\\nbeen injured at work . . .\\n\\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \\nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \\nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don\\'t know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \\ndown, I don\\'t remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \\nwe\\'ve identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\\n\\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it\\'s time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \\nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he\\'s sick? I should inform \\nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can\\'t do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \\nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \\nget here from Yerevan? There\\'s no transportation, it s impossible.\"\\n\\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \\nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \\nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I\\'m \\nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \\nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \\narson? Don\\'t they know what\\'s going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don\\'t have anyone \\nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\\nsays, \"Let\\'s bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \\nif it calms down, I\\'ll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\\n\\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \\nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \\n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you\\'re \\ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \\n\"Yes.\" \"And now you\\'re telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \\nforgot!\" Like that.\\n\\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \\nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \\ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it\\'s unclear\\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \\njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What\\'s your nationality?\" He \\nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he\\'s an\\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don\\'t know, they did something there, too \\n. . . it\\'s too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \\nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \\nthat\\'s where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \\nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \\n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\\n\\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \\nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\\nwere taken. He says he didn\\'t take them\\n\\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\\nit, that hasn\\'t been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \\nhave the trial when you don\\'t know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\\nI didn\\'t get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven\\'t straightened \\neverything out, I think that\\'s unjust.\"\\n\\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \\nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\\npercent of his body . . .\\n\\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \\ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \\nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \\ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \\nArmy. And now they\\'re fatherless...\\n\\nI couldn\\'t sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\\nyears\\' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn\\'t\\nknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are \\nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years\\' \\ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\\ncreep, with my bare hands I\\'ll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest.

Gill\\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\\n\\nDate: 93/5/16\\n\\n\\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you\\'ve ever downloaded\\nimages from BBS or the net, you\\'ve probably noticed (with most image\\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\\n(or the lack of it).\\n\\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn\\'t_ give you\\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\\nsomething like this:\\n\\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\\n\\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\\n\\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\\n\\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \\nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\\nimages with a program that doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then it will\\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\\n\\nWhose fault is all this ?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\\nout there that don\\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is\\nthat most image formats don\\'t specify a standard gamma, or\\ndon\\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\\ngamma\\'s.\\n\\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\\n\\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\\n\\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\\'t provide an easy way of modifying the\\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\\nin the HSV controls doesn\\'t do the right thing, as it fails to\\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\\nto give a tint to the image. ]\\n\\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\\nbit.)\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\\nwill be above the center.\\n\\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\\naround 2.2 \\n\\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\\n-dispgamma flag, and once you\\'ve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\\n\\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\\nto some degree or other.\\n\\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will\\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\\n\\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \\ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\\nimages at the popular level.\\n\\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\\n\\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).\\n\\n###########################################################################\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Basically, what I think \\nI\\'ve observed is that the phrase \"the Ten Commandments\", \\nas used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but \\nrather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. \\n20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase \"the Ten \\nCommandments\" should more accurately be translated \"the \\nTen Discourses\", of which the passage we call the \"Ten \\nCommandments\" is really only the first.\\n\\nI\\'m not completely convinced that the above is true, but \\nfor purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I \\nwas sure.\\n\\nArguments supporting the above idea:\\n\\n1)  There aren\\'t really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  \\nIn order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of \\nthem out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not \\nsupport such a division because they are all about not \\nworshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to \\nhave no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship \\nthe idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can\\'t violate \\nverses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that \\nthe whole passage is one command, and leaving us with \\nonly Nine \"Commandments\".  I could go on at length about \\nthis, but for now I\\'ll just stop with this summary.\\n\\n2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning\\nof the traditional \"Ten Commandments\") and Ex 31:18 \\n(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the \\nTen Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break \\nthese ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; \\n25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; \\n31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these \\npassages begins with some variation of the phrase, \"And \\nthe LORD spoke to Moses, saying...\"  The exception is \\nEx. 21:1, which begins \"Now these are the ordinances \\nwhich you are to set before them...\"\\n\\n3)  The word translated \"commandments\" in the phrase \\n\"the Ten Commandments\" isn\\'t really the word for \\n\"commandment\", its the word for a speech, or an \\nutterance.  It\\'s a word often used for longer discourses \\nrather than individual statements; for instance, when \\ncombined with the word \\'yom\\' (day), this word is \\ntranslated \"Chronicles\" in such phrases as \"now the rest \\nof the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the \\nChronicles of x?...\"  The word for \"commandment\" is \\nfreely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps \\nit is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X\\'s, \\nhe appears to have avoided the word for commandment and \\nchosen instead a word associated with discourses longer \\nthan just a single command.\\n\\n4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the \\nstone tablets \"with the law and the commandments\" (Ex \\n24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He \\nhas finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the \\nTen Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not \\nimmediately clear why God would wait several days and \\nnine more discourses before giving these tablets to \\nMoses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses \\nwritten on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that \\nGod would not give Moses the tablets until He had \\nfinished delivering all Ten Discourses.\\n\\n5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both \\ntablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If \\nthese Ten \"Commandments\" were only the first 17 verses \\nof Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE \\nletters!  Not that He couldn\\'t have, of course, but it \\ndoes seem more likely to me that this is a reference to \\ntwo tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-\\nsized letters.\\n\\n6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out \\nthe \"commandments written on stone\" as being the \\n\"ministry of death\", \"that which is fading away,\" and \\n\"the ministry of condemnation.\"  With the possible \\nexception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is \\ndifficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17 as being temporary, \"fading away\"-type \\ncommandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone \\ntablets should happen to have included all of the \\ncommandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.\\n\\nArguments against this idea:\\n\\nThe main argument against this idea, aside from the fact \\nthat it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that \\nin Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17, \"These words the LORD spoke...and He added \\nno more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and \\ngave them to me.\"  This appears to identify the words \\njust quoted as being the only contents of the two stone \\ntablets.\\n\\nThat was my first impression, anyway.  However, after \\nsome thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how \\nyou understand the phrase \"These words.\"  If Moses meant \\n\"These words *which I have just related to you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc., then that would mean that only the \\ntraditional \"Ten Commandments\" were on the stone \\ntablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical \\ncomment--\"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc.--then that\\'s quite different.\\n\\nI did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of \\nbeing given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the \\npeople asking Moses to represent them before God, \\nwhereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of \\nMoses between the first and second discourses, several \\ndays BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This \\nreinforces the idea that Moses\\' remarks in Dt 5:22ff \\nwere intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a \\nstrictly chronological account of when God wrote what, \\nand at what point He stopped adding to what was on the \\ntablets.\\n\\nSummary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more \\nlikely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only \\nthe first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses \\nof God.  I don\\'t know if anybody has ever espoused this \\nidea before; it\\'s brand-new to me.  So, while I lean \\ntowards accepting it, I would be very interested in \\nhearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to \\noffer.\\n\\n- Mark\\n'),\n",

I came \\nhome from school at 12 o\\'clock, being excused to leave before the last period \\nin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was \\nthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and \\nother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first \\ncousin\\'s birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and \\non the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring \\nthat I\\'d have enough time to do my homework for the next day.\\n\\nWhen we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped \\nby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. \\nThe driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus\\nbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to \\nthe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking \\npassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not \\ntaken for Armenians.\\n\\nWe set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old \\nbuilding where we knew there\\'d be a place to hide, but the whole road was \\npacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th \\nMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people\\'s pockets and checking\\npassports. People who didn\\'t have passports with them were beaten as well.\\nThen we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning\\ncars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \"Death to\\nthe Armenians\" was written on the cars.\\n\\nWhen we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still\\nquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn\\'t turn on any lights. We tried to call \\nBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. \\nThen there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to \\ncome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us\\nto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you \\nenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was \\nbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors\\' daughter said that that\\'s right, \\nthat\\'s what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people \\nwere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn\\'t stay very \\nlong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, \\nlooking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said \\nthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a\\ncar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that \\nthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that \\nthere weren\\'t any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \\nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \\nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\\nAvakian was killed, too.\\n\\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \\nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn\\'t turn on the light. We \\nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\\ndecided she had already left.\\n\\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father\\'s\\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn\\'t want to give him our address,\\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\\n\\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \\nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \\ncould do. One of them took my parents\\' passports and began to read them. He \\nread the surname \"Danielian,\" turned the page, read \"Armenian,\" and that alone\\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \\ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \\npushed some of the keys on the piano and said \"your death has tolled.\" They \\nhad knives and steel truncheons.\\n\\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t use it. I just knew that if\\nI didn\\'t give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \\nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \\noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\\npush her so she\\'d walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \\nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \\nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\\n\\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \\nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \\nstrike me, and I\\'m knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \\nlose consciousness often . . . I don\\'t see or hear my parents, since I was the\\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \\ntheir balconies. That\\'s it. I try to pick them up, but can\\'t. My left arm is \\nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \\nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\\n\\nWe were attacked at around 9 o\\'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \\ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors\\' door, \\nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \\nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \\nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can\\'t see very far as a \\nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \\naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \\naway, and everything will be OK.\\n\\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \\no\\'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \\nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \\nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o\\'clock I and the other Armenians who are \\nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\\n\\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\\nbefore the 27th.\\n\\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \\nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \\nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \\nthat they were dead. My father\\'s older brother told me.\\n\\nMy father\\'s name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \\nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \\nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\\n\\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner\\'s report stated that their\\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\\n\\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \\nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \\nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \\nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn\\'t know the address.\\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \\nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \\ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \\nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \\ncalled from home, which also isn\\'t true. I heard noise and the sounds of \\nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \\nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \\nyears old. I don\\'t know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \\nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\\n\\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \\ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \\nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \\nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town\\'s construction. Mamma was from \\nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \\na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\\n\\n\\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \\nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\\n\\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \\nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\\n\\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\\n\\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\\n\\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \\nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \\nArmenia.\\n\\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\\ncan do that.\\n\\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \\nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\\n\\nYou can\\'t take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \\neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \\nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \\nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \\na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \\nin the hands of our government.\\n\\nJune 13,1988\\n\\nStepanakert \\n\\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\\nS.D.P.A.

This is an improved\\nversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}\\n\\nThe standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents \\nis probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \"Hermeneutrik und \\nKritik,\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of\\n_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:\\nBeck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The \\nProphetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).\\n(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley\\ndescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little\\nknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject\\nand the reader.)  Nibley\\'s extract from Blass\\'s work is in the form\\nof \"rules for forgers.\"  It makes interesting reading.\\n\\nI confess that I have not read Blass\\'s work, only Nibley\\'s extract\\nthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and\\nas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,\\nI believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that \\nany competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient\\ndocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one \\nwould expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not \\nbe able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to \\ndetermine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and \\nculture or is a later forgery.\\n\\nActually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:\\n\\n1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example\\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific\\nmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found\\nwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual\\nphysical objects.\\n\\n2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the\\ncopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a\\ndocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something\\nfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several\\ngenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still \\nbe tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot\\nexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so\\nwe must confine our testing to the text itself.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if\\nthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the\\ndocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I\\'ve heard\\nof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king\\nin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up\\nscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the\\nholograph).  They could check the language, content and writing\\nstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a\\nPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were\\npositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually\\nwrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but\\n(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for \\ncomparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to\\ndetermine who the actual author was.\\n\\nAs I say, I\\'m no expert on Blas\\'s work.  I do remember some of the\\ntests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  \\nSpecifically we might ask:\\n\\n1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict\\nitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to \\nmaintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The \\nlonger the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.\\nFor this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.\\n\\n2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?\\nAgain a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the\\nwriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be\\nable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous\\nthings which someone from that culture would get right without even\\nthinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous \\nand trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.\\n\\n3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech\\netc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that \\nseem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  \\nIf so do they fit in with the culture?\\n\\nOf course there are complications if the document has been\\ntranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language\\nwhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture\\nclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and\\nreduce certainty to be sure but don\\'t necessarily prove forgery.\\n\\nThese tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work \\nwith) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the \\nhistorian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to \\nask are, \"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we \\nknow about the culture of claimed origin?\"  If there are things \\nwhich don\\'t fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to\\nour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really \\nsignificant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never\\nknow everything about the culture.\\n\\nThe end result of any such testing is occasionally certain\\n(particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies).\\nHowever often it may just be a probability or an indication that\\nthe document (or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic (or\\nsometimes maybe other parts are later additions).  This is often \\nunsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems are\\nsolved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials.  It is, \\nhowever, the real world and what scholarship has to offer.\\n'),\n",

First \\nsome background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, \\nand am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on \\nit.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician \\nGold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by \\nhaving a device driver detect whenever more than one read is \\nnecessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, \\nand minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard \\ndrive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad \\nsectors a week.\\n \\n        Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with \\nan Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this \\nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \\nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \\nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \\nsectors for a brief period of time.\\n \\n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \\nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \\nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \\nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \\nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \\nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \\neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \\ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\\n \\n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \\nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \\nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \\nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \\nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \\ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \\nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\\n \\n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \\nmy hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in \\nabout every 100 files are affected.  \\n \\n        I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s \\nsystem, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about \\nsmartdrv to help me out.\\n\\n--                    \\nINTERNET:  jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver)\\nUUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriver\\nNetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115\\n\"),\n",

When that light goes on, I just\\ntake it to the delaer tell them \"It\\'s that time\" and they work on it for 4 hou\\nand you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)\\nI currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for\\nservice, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the\\nOxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have\\nnever had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.\\nNow, I don\\'t have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have\\nsomething to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only\\nMAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced\\nif you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and\\nGasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  \\n\\nWhat I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need\\nto, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don\\'t worry about the car for\\nanother 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light\\nbothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against\\nthe dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light\\nwill go off.  I do that so that little light won\\'t annoy me.  If you can\\'t\\nfind it, look it up in the car manuel.

And even when it\\nis a \"pure\" pursuit of knowledge, presumably one pursues knowledge in order\\nto personally grow, develop, advance to a higher plane of being. So there\\nis still an element of acquisition, of reaching, of grasping, even in the\\napproach of the \"detached, objective\" scientist. \\n\\n>>Now if we\\'re valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure,\\n>>science cannot be valued non-subjectively.   If we\\'re picking facts\\n>>and hypotheses subjectively, then we are using a maybe-not-quite-sure\\n>>method on maybe-not-quite-sure observations.  That should lead\\n>>to maybe-not-quite-sure results, no?  The fact that it does not seem\\n>>to might make one question the premise, which is that our subjective\\n>>valuations are necessarily unreliable.\\n>\\n>>O.K., which DES?  The abstract function DES? that stops working in any \\n>>important sense if no-one cares for the importance of truth, mathematics, \\n>>meaning, information, etc.  A DES chip or DES s/w?  That stops working in any \\n>>important sense if no-one values science, objective reality, etc.   DES\\n>>does not work in a value vacuum.  Nothing else does, either.\\n>\\n>The D.E.S. chip works just fine, even if I don\\'t know that it exists.\\n>You are confusing _why we are using the chip_ with _the chip works_.\\n>They aren\\'t the same.\\n\\nNo, I think you are the one who is rather confused. There are two senses\\nin which we can say that the phenomenon of \"the working of the DES chip\" is \\nvalue-based:\\n\\n\\t1) Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES\\n\\t   chip and started it running in the first place\\n\\n\\t\\tand\\n\\n\\t2) Because the very notion/definition/concept of \"works\" has value\\n\\t   associated with it\\n\\nThe first is a CAUSAL linkage -- we want it to work, therefore we CAUSE it to \\nwork. That is rather a mundane interpretation. The second, however, is a more \\nsubtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage -- that the attribute \"works\" is \\nitself, as everything else, presented to the human consciousness as a _valued_ \\nfact, not just a fact-in-itself. You are perhaps justified in shooting down \\nthe causal linkage, but you have not begun to address the phenomenological \\nlinkage.\\n\\n>Suns in unpopulated solar systems shine without being blessed by your\\n>values. \\n\\nOur predictions or confirmations that suns shine in unpopulated solar systems\\nare, however, items of value.\\n\\n>Genetic algorithms (closely related to the scientific method)\\n>can work without intervention of any kind. \\n\\nAgain, our predictions or confirmations of the working of genetic algorithms\\nare items of value.\\n\\n>Your claim is without merit;\\n>the universe does not depend on human values, any more than it\\n>revolves around earth.\\n\\nThe universe does not DEPEND on human values, no, but our experience and\\nunderstanding and concepts of the universe _are_ laced with human values.\\nPhenomenologically, everything is value-related, since the thing which is \\nexperiencing the phenomena, i.e. self, is itself value-driven.

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?\\n\\nI was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack\\nbeing a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key\\nfor the family key SK.\\n\\n        The unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\\n        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\\n        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\\n        Compute the 64-bit block\\n\\n                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]\\n\\n        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\\n        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\\n        (I\\'m unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\\n        they\\'re called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\\n        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\\n        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\\n\\nThe seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on\\na laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people\\nso that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during\\nan entire \"programming session\" to generate keys for a stream of serial\\nnumbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be\\nthrown out if desired).\\n\\nThe serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed\\nby padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding\\nfor each value).\\n\\nThe resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired\\nup with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The\\nfloppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two\\nescrow agencies.\\n\\nDorothy Denning\\ndenning@cs.georgetown.edu\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\nI am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.\\nPlease remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree\\nwith it\\'s contents and implications. So don\\'t swamp my mailbox :-)\\n\\nI just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical\\ndiscussion that is rising here. And, no, I don\\'t mind if you call\\nS1 and S2 \\'backdoor\\', as I could imagine the key-generation process\\nworking without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the\\nSerial-Number.\\n\\n\\nFriendly greetings,\\n\\n\\tGermano Caronni\\n-- \\nInstruments register only through things they\\'re designed to register.\\nSpace still contains infinite unknowns.\\n                                                              PGP-Key-ID:341027\\nGermano Caronni caronni@nessie.cs.id.ethz.ch   FD560CCF586F3DA747EA3C94DD01720F\\n'),\n",

(\"Useful in making some conclusion\" is \\n#an accuracy judgement again, I\\'m afraid.) \\n\\nThis is the root of the problem: I bloomin\\' well amn\\'t punning on the\\nword value!!!  I know it\\'s ambiguous.  I\\'ve told you the sense in\\nwhich I\\'m using it (worth, use, goodness, etc).  And value DOESN\\'T mean\\naccuracy, by any stretch of the imagination.  Value=result of a computation,\\nis not what I mean, but I accept it as a possible misinterpretation of\\n\\'value\\'.  Value == accuracy comes from out of left field.  \\n\\nI can only understand that by \\'\"useful in making some conclusion\" is an accuracy\\njudgement\\' you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in making\\nthat conclusion or not.   That\\'s part of what I mean by objective\\nvaluation - values grounded in solid facts.  One doesn\\'t value x for the \\npurpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn\\'t really do that. The\\nrest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values (e.g.  our own \\nfreedom) are solid facts in themselves.\\n\\nConsider each of the following statements:\\n\\n(1) The only reason that the distinction between \\'accurate\\' and \\n\\'inaccurate\\' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful.  \\n\\n(2) The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of people\\nfinds the distinction between \\'accurate\\' and \\'inaccurate\\' useful in\\ndealing with phenomena.\\n\\n(3) Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful in\\nmodelling phenomena.\\n\\nWhere is the \\'pun\\' of which you speak?  Where am I arguing from idiom?  \\nAnd what is wrong, if those statements are true, with concluding that \"the \\nbasis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena, i.e. \\n\\'subjective\\' values\"?    After all, what on earth is (3), if not a \\n\\'subjective\\' value judgement?  (an \\'accurate\\' value judgement, maybe?)\\n\\nJust to illustrate what I mean: what\\'s the difference between saying\\n\\'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we have\\nto model phenomena\\' and (say) \\'Love and intelligence are the best tools we have\\nto achieve freedom\\'?  Is one \\'objective\\', the other not?  Both are \\njudgements about value (\"best\"), and both have the same empirical basis, from \\nwhere _I_ sit.\\n\\n#Sorry, Frank, but all you\\'re doing is\\n#using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue.

Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\\n> It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\\n> me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\\n> was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\\n> exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it.

So I told her how my pal had made a\\n> mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\\n> cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\\n> they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\\n> the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\\n> was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\\n> Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\\n> him straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled off\\n> something.\\n>\\n> Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\\n> in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\\n> spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\\n> blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shut\\n> up\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\\n> straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\\n> something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'All\\n> right, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look at\\n> another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\\n> saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\\n> help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\\n> this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\\n> into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\\n> I was becoming mad.

A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\\n> shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\\n\\n\\nSigh.\\n\\nFour (4) deer in Tel Aviv ?? Well, this is probably as accurate as the rest of\\nthis fantasy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n> hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\\n> We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\\n> deer more and went to take a look.

We carefully\\n> inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\\n> the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\\n> had hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\n> so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\n> revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\n> distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\n> bullets sinking in.

It is due to thermal fatigue.  You turn on\\nyour computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it\\ncools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles\\nof this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics\\nare much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact\\nportable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function\\nthat extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal\\ncycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my\\ncomputer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it\\noff (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the\\nphosphor).

I've only tried it on the coiled nylon type, and\\nit doesn't take much squish to fix the problem. I found I was overdoing\\nit (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after\\nspreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not\\nthe usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so\\nthey were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the\\nadjusting screw a bit.

But one obvious reason\\nwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\\nhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\\nwe would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact\\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\\nand my faith would be vanity.\\n\\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\\nsays why in John 15:18-25.   That\\'s no mystery either.  \"The\\nworld hates him without reason.\"  It is a direct proclamation\\nof how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we\\nneed a Saviour.\\n\\nAnd why can\\'t you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  \"The\\nworld cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows\\nhim.\"  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge\\nthat comes out in your twistings of Robert\\'s daily verses is\\nvery convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.\\nI pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of\\nknowledge.

The properly-formed conscience can\\nbe trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something\\nso materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess\\nanything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were\\ndiscussing the \"mind\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal,\\nas it were; and half spiritual. \\n\\n?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\\n?possibility of error appears.

We interpret this passage\\n?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\\n?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.

To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\\n?cannot be certain.\\n\\nThis argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a\\nconclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me\\nof the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of\\na measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying\\nto measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the\\nmeasurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to\\ndetermine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this\\nknowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough\\nto allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation.\\nTherefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\ncompetence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\nability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\nnot subject to the experimental method. \\n\\n?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n?\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\\n?

They\\nwon\\'t be too useful in certain areas, but leveling the Pentagon\\nwould be a \"good thing\" for said overthrow and it\\'s likely one man\\ncarrying a backpack would stand a better chance than one thousand\\narmed with Colt Peacemakers.  Don\\'t let self-defense become the\\nonly reason you can have a gun and your sole means of justification.\\nMyself, I won\\'t overthrow my government until it ceases to be my\\nlegal government, but if I need to I want every weapon I can get.\\n\\n\\tOne can just as easily say no rifle larger than a .22 is\\nneeded to kill a human being.  They are right.  When that human\\nbeing is wearing armor and riding in an APC, things get a bit\\ndifferent.  I don\\'t see where the weapon is a problem.

The following letter, which represents a small portion \\nof the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical \\ndocuments, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, \\nwas sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, \\nprogram directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and \\nradio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide \\nof 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people \\nof Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the \\nlost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is \\nmourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their \\nlives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations \\nmay live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and \\nprosperously.\\n\\n------------------------- letter ----------------------------------\\n\\nDuring the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nhas planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which \\nnot only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the \\nmethod used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, \\nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \\nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \\nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\\n\\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \\nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \\nGenocide.\\n\\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \\nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\\n\\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\\n\\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\\n\\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \\nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \\nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \\nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \\nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \\ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \\nof the Turkish Genocide.\\n\\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \\ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\\n\\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \\nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \\nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \\nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\\n\\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \\nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \\n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \\ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \\narmed struggle.

Jagr did not have a better season than\\n     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of\\n     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\\n     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\\n\\n     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\\n     time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out\\n     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\\n     against the other team\\'s top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\\n     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\\n     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\\n\\nThank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the\\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you\\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-\\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\\nwould argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\\nplay.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center\\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy\\nfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like\\novertime of playoff games).\\n\\n--\\nRoland Dreier                                        dreier@math.berkeley.edu\\n'),\n",

However, if he enjoyed\\npunishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus\\nto \"seek and save that which was lost\" (Luke 19:10)?\\n\\n>\\n>To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with\\n>the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the Bible\\n>teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.  Their\\n>judgement is soon to come.\\n>\\n>Let me suggest this.  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory\\n>should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.  Stay away\\n>from human theories, and only take into account references in the bible.\\n>\\nYou asked for it.\\n\\n2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished.\\nMatthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in\\nGod\\'s eyes will be sent to hell for eternity.\\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the\\ndisciples \"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out\\nfrom the presence of the Lord\".\\n2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth\\nbeing condemned.\\nRevelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes\\nand those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in\\nthe \"fiery lake of burning sulfur\".\\nRevelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast\\n\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\" and there being \"no rest day or\\nnight\" for them because of it.\\nPsalm 9:17:  \"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that\\nforget God.\"\\n\\nI think those should be sufficient to prove the point.\\n\\n>Darius\\n\\nJoe Fisher\\n\\n[In the following I\\'m mostly playing \"devil\\'s advocate\".  I\\'m not\\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\\nit\\'s possible to see these passages in different ways.  It\\'s possible\\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\\nthere\\'s a wide enough variety of images that it\\'s possible to\\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\\nimplies that the damned don\\'t get resurrected at all.  Presumably\\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I\\'m aware that it\\'s possible to \\nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\\n\\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn\\'t eternal punishement.\\n\\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\\neternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\\nthe devil, and humans?\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\\nunderstood either way, but I think it\\'s at least possible to think\\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\\neternity.\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\\nit doesn\\'t explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \\nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn\\'t say that the people\\nare tormented forever.\\n\\nPsalm 9:17:  I don\\'t see that it says anything relevant to this issue.\\n\\n--clh]\\n'),\n",

The most recent\\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\\npolice.\"2\\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960\\'s  the  female\\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\\nrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,\\nthe completion rate drops to 3%.\\n \\n1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine\\nde Gruyter, NY, 1991\\n2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A\\nSurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,\\n1986\\n-------\\n\\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

In the last few\\nyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It\\'s\\ndriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is\\nthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to \\ndo it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we \\npresent to God.  But the best Masses I\\'ve been to were participatory prayers.\\n\\nLately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion\\nof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do\\n(which is necessary because no one knows what\\'s happening next) is growing.\\nExample.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually\\non Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking\\nthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\\n\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we\\'d do it\\nagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sit\\nduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", \\nI was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems\\ntypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the\\nmusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\\nliturgy and since no one knows what\\'s happening, the new things have to be\\nexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we\\'re just\\nsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\\nto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\\n\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\\nbias toward doing something rather than nothing--that\\'s just a fact of\\nbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\\npeople to be aware of the Lord\\'s presence.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\\ngoing down?  I don\\'t mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\\nFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \\nof God\\'s presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \\njust offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\\nparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?\\n\\nJohn Murray\\n'),\n",

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\\n    150MPH.)\\n\\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\\n    per-tire loads:\\n\\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\\n\\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\\n\\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\\n    all.\\n\\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\\n\\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\\n\\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\\n\\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\\n    normal tires on the car?\\n\\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\\n\\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\\n    of my car?\\n\\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\\n\\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\\n    car should I put them on?\\n\\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\\n\\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\\n\\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\\n    in this Q&A posting?\\n\\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\\n\\nSafety Equipment:\\n\\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\\n\\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\\n\\nBrake Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\\n    always wants to do this.\\n\\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\\n    or badly grooved.\\n\\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\\n    this really a good idea?\\n\\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\\n\\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\\n\\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\\n\\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\\n\\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\\n\\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\\n\\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\\n\\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\\n    economics are questionable for street use.\\n\\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\\n    information at this time.\\n\\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\\n    more.  Is it worth it?\\n\\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\\n\\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\\n\\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\\n    eventuality.\\n\\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\\n\\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\\n    ABS system in your car.\\n\\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\\n    becomes very important.\\n\\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\\n\\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\\n    needed here -- rpw]\\n\\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\\n    not very near the threshold.\\n\\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\\n    take over.\\n\\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \\n\\nGas Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\\n\\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\\n    needs.\\n\\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\\n\\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\\n\\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\\n\\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\\n\\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\\n    cars.\\n\\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\\n    in your gas tank.\\n\\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\\n\\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\\n\\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\\n\\nLubrication Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\\n\\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\\t\\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\\n\\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\\n\\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\\n\\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\\n\\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\\n    your wallet at all times.\\n\\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\\n\\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\\n\\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\\n\\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\\n\\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\\n    as conventional oils.\\n\\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\\n\\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\\n    How often should I change my oil?\\n\\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\\n    of storage.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\\n    break.  What's the story?\\n\\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\\n\\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\\n\\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\\n\\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\\n    oriented vehicles.\\n\\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\\n\\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\\n    is probably the cause.\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\\n\"),\n",

Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the \\nfrequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the \\ncandida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus \\nshould be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the \\nintestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to \\noxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the \\nlay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I\\'m really \\namazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.\\n\\n\\nThe calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all \\nconventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if \\nconventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard \\nmedical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?\\nThe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very \\nimportant one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria \\nafter antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason \\nto dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply \\nand safely(like it is in animal husbandry).\\n\\nMarty B.\\n\\n'),\n",

If neither the output or\\ninput presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively\\ncoupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and\\nfrom the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any\\ncoupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.\\n\\nIf the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than\\njust coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before\\nswitching with coupling capacitors of your own.\\n\\nIf you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input\\nthrough to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching\\nwhere for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch\\nchange. This may mask the switch click.\\n\\nAn audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and\\nmaking your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)\\nsealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles\\nuse this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes\\na complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.\\nRadio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.\\n\\nFor a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try \\nlooking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its\\nolder predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed\\nprior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete\\nand IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).\\nAll the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily\\nmake a subject for a multi-page article.\\n\\nSolid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on\\ndue to charge being injected into the audio line through device\\ncapacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to\\nminimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through\\nthe switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the\\ncontrol pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as\\nputting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.\\n\\nHope this helps at least get you started.\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n\"),\n",

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to\\neducation, to establish a family and have children, to human\\ndignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are\\nmore important to human existence that the rights of states.\\n\\n2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and\\nrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.\\n\\n3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as\\nJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an\\nunresolved conflict exists.\\n\\n4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of\\npeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples\\nand nations.\\n\\n5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars\\nin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.\\n\\n6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional\\npolitical means have failed.\\n\\n7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two\\ndistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the\\nland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.\\n\\n8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake\\nof peace and justice. When people love, they share.\\n\\nHaving stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\\n\\n1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants\\nfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew\\nand the other Palestinian-Arab.\\n\\n2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove\\nthat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli\\ncitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,\\nalthough born in areas under current Isreali control, is not\\nentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.\\n\\n3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For\\nthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each\\nsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.\\n\\n\\n4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which\\nhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the\\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and\\nChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of\\ngovernments and international organizations.\\n\\n5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'\\nmarriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on\\n'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its\\nethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a\\ntruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of\\npeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into the\\nMiddle-East in a graceful manner.\\n\\nObjections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will\\nattempt to identify some of these:\\n\\n1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected\\nforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,\\nit is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is\\nrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the\\nperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International\\nlaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at\\nreducing racial discrimination and segregation.\\n\\n2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\\nis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is\\na conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous\\ncolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed\\nstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the\\n'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but\\nIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be\\ndefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill\\nthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental\\nhuman rights over collective rights (see above)\\n\\n3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of\\nfinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their\\npoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People\\noverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of\\nhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar\\nBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he\\ngave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing\\nassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its\\neffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit\\neither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see\\nabove)\\n\\n4.      It may objected that only a few people in\\nIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus\\nnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that\\nalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect\\nof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed\\ncouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and\\nencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist\\nattitudes.\\n\\n5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to\\nbring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has\\nmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than\\n$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government\\nand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the\\nMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would\\nsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable\\nclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in\\nIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a\\nnon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.\\n\\nI would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as\\nwell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful\\ndiscussion and enrichment.\\n\\nElias Davidsson Post Box 1760 121 Reykjavik, ICELAND\\n\\n\"),\n",

I moved there from\\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\\nArutunian, my husband\\'s name . . .\\n\\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \\nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \\nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \\nyear. I couldn\\'t find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \\nI, I\\'ll just say it, couldn\\'t steal, couldn\\'t deceive, and couldn\\'t be \\ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \\ntold me, \"Leave, don\\'t keep the others from working, you aren\\'t cut out for \\nthis kind of work.\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \\nthe Armenians, like \"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\\nthey\\'ve multiplied here they\\'re making it hard for us to live,\" and \"Things \\nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\" \"No problem, the Turks will \\nhelp,\" they say, \"if we ask them, they\\'ll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \\nhour.\" Well that\\'s the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \\nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn\\'t imagine it. \\nHere we\\'ve been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \\neven considered such an idea possible.\\n\\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \\npeople I would often ask, \"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \\nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what\\'s going\\non?\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \\neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \\nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn\\'t be saying this now if I \\nhadn\\'t received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \\nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \\nThe women told me, \"There he is, there he is, that\\'s Muslimzade.\" I didn\\'t \\nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \\nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \"Are you the First \\nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\" He answers me, \"Yes.\" And I ask him, \\n\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \\nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don\\'t know \\nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\\nme, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\\nanother question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \\nus? And he said, \"I. . . We didn\\'t know what to do, we didn\\'t know, we didn\\'t \\nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\"\\n\\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \\nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \"No, we actually didn\\'t \\nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \\nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\" Those are his \\nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\\nArmenian SSR.\\n\\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it\\'s painful to discuss them, \\nbecause it may seem that it\\'s not true to someone else. Various rumors \\nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren\\'t. \\nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \\nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\\nprogress, I don\\'t know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\\nor around Moscow, I wouldn\\'t have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \\na genocide, it was a massacre. That\\'s genuinely what it was.\\n\\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn\\'t know about the 27th because my \\nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \\nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You\\'re in bed? You don\\'t \\nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \\nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \\nand asking, \\'Are you an Armenian?\\' If they answered in Armenian, then they \\nturned the car over and burned it.\" This isn\\'t made up, the wife of the Senior\\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \\nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she\\'s my \\nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \\nmiddle of it, I don\\'t know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \\nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn\\'t even believe it, and \\nI said, \"Certainly that didn\\'t happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \\n\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \\nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don\\'t break \\nthe shop windows, don\\'t destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\\n\" I didn\\'t hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \\nalthough he\\'s an Azerbaijani.\\n\\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\\nis the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there\\'s a crowd out \\nthere.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \\nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \\nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I\\'m sorry, I \\ndon\\'t know the building number or the people\\'s names, since we were in my \\nhusband\\'s apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \\nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \\nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \\nwasn\\'t enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn\\'t finished\\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \\nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \\nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \\ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn\\'t tell \\nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn\\'t \\nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn\\'t dared to stick up for the \\nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\\n\\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \\nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \\noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \\nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \\nfirst I couldn\\'t figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \\n\"Lendrush, l think they\\'re beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \\ndon\\'t know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \\nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \\nhe didn\\'t see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \\nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \\ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \\nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \\nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that\\'s a good block and a half or two \\nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\\n\\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\\n\\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \\nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it\\'s true, \\ndefended us, they said, \"There aren\\'t any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \\nonly Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\\n\\nBut at two o\\'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \\ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he\\'s \\nupset about something, but I can\\'t. I was standing, running from balcony to \\nbalcony. Our power was out, I don\\'t remember for how long, but it was as \\nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \\nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \\nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \\ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \\nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \\nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \\ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\\ngarbage out at two o\\'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \\ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \\ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \\nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \\nthey answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \\nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don\\'t \\nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \\ntalking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \\nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \\nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\\n\\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \\nI don\\'t know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \\nreally didn\\'t know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \\nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \\nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \\nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \\nand was getting ready to give his daughter\\'s hand in marriage, but, alas,\\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \\nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \\nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \\nhadn\\'t already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \\nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \\nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \\nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \\napartments. Something on the order of \"We\\'ll move the Armenians out and take \\nover their apartments.\"\\n\\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \\ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \\nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \\nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \\nSumgait that there wasn\\'t anything holy about them, that Party membership was \\nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \\nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \\nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\\n\\nI can\\'t talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \\nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \\nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \\nthe situation the way it was. And what\\'s interesting is that when we left on \\nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \\npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \\nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \\nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \\nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \\nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn\\'t want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \\nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \\ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn\\'t have people at hand to whom\\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \\nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let\\'s protect our \\nneighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren\\'t such that there was no \\ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn\\'t have firearms, \\nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \\nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \\nnoticed them: there aren\\'t rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \\nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \\nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \\nus, why wasn\\'t it arranged? It means that the government didn\\'t want to do \\nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \\nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won\\'t mention the things \\nI didn\\'t see myself, I\\'ll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \\nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o\\'clock in the evening, when I saw them\\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \\no\\'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\\nhadn\\'t completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \\nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \\npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \\ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \\nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \\nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \\nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \\nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \\nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can\\'t remember the name of it, where there\\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I\\'m upset and\\nI can\\'t think of the name . . . there\\'s a tall building there, a 9-story, and \\nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \\nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \\nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \\nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \\nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \\nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \\nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \\ninvolved.\\n\\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\\ntruth, I\\'ve been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \\nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \\nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I\\'m an adventure seeker, and\\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \\nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\\nor the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I\\'ll get you \\nout of here; If I want to, I\\'ll get rid of you; If I want to, I\\'ll do \\nsomething else? And there\\'s a black market price for everything, in the most \\nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor\\'s pool, he had \\nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won\\'t even believe this, but this, I\\'m afraid,\\nI heard with my own ears: \"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\\nthat you know will never have any effect? You\\'re alone against everyone, so \\ninstead why don\\'t you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \\nwill go fine for you.\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \\ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \\nit, I still have a copy, but what\\'s the use? When the General Procuracy got \\ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \\nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \\nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don\\'t know \\nif they\\'re going to pursue it or not. Because, you\\'ll excuse me, I no longer \\nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It\\'s all \\ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \\nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that\\'s nonsense, that\\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \\nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\\n\\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don\\'t know, at the time I was in such a\\nstate that I didn\\'t even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\\nOf course, it\\'s not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\\nVitaly [Danielian], I don\\'t know his last name, goes to school with him, or\\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there\\'s one important detail:\\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren\\'t working in \\nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \\nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\\nliked They weren\\'t afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \\ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\\n\\nNow I\\'m going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \\nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\\nhis mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik\\'s, what if they kill\\nhim? Maybe he\\'s still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\\n. . . He\\'s a nice guy, we all like him, he\\'s a good person, he\\'s smart.\" His \\nmother wouldn\\'t let him go. In tears, she says, \"Valery, you can\\'t go because \\nI am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We\\'ll just watch, \\njust have a look.\" They made it through. I don\\'t know, I think Vitalik\\'s\\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \\nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \\neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \\napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \\nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \\nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \\nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \\nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn\\'t even know they were dead. So two weeks \\nago, I don\\'t know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \\nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \\nYerevan. So it\\'s been about a month already; it\\'s so hard to keep all this \\nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik\\'s family has\\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn\\'t admit \\nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \\na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \\nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \\nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\\n\\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \\nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \\nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\\n\\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \\nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \\nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I\\'m not lying, \\nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \\nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \\nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \\nI don\\'t know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\\n\\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\\npoint when I couldn\\'t even go outside because if you went outside you saw\\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\\n\\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\\nwith bulldozers. I didn\\'t know whether to believe it or not. And people who \\ndon\\'t know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \\nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \\nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \\nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \\nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \\nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn\\'t attack \\nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don\\'t\\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \\nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \\nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \\nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \\npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \\nArmenian?\"\\n\\nOf course I\\'m upset, but it\\'s utterly impossible to discuss such things and\\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \\ncouldn\\'t believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \\ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \\nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \\ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\\nalready sick. It\\'s true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \\ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \\nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \\nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \\nwere never given any direct orders, they didn\\'t know what they were authorized\\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o\\'clock in the evening\\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \\nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \\npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \\nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \\ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\\nhand and said, \"Citizen, don\\'t worry, we\\'ll go and have a talk in my office.\\nI told him, \"No, after everything you\\'ve done, I don\\'t believe one iota of \\nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I\\'ll disappear, and the \\ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can\\'t stand it when . . . \" Oh \\nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \\nvery funny, although at the time I wasn\\'t up to laughing. He was in a nice, \\nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \\ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\\nyou\\'re in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\\nthem?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don\\'t know who \\nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade\\'s head \\nand hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We\\'re not marauders. We\\'re not you! We \\ndidn\\'t come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \\nMuslimzade says to me, \"But I\\'m not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I\\'m not\\nguilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you\\'re not guilty, have it your way. But give \\nus an answer, we\\'re asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \\nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \\ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \\nthen?\" \"You know, we didn\\'t expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn\\'t \\nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \\nlaughing and said, \"It\\'s truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn\\'t \\nknow what to do.\" And I say, \"I\\'m sorry, but it\\'ll be ridiculous if I tell \\nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn\\'t march out in \\nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \\nover his dead body. That\\'s what you should have done. That\\'s the way it was \\nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \\naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \\nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \\nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \\nThat\\'s right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \\nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \\nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \\nimpunity. And if it weren\\'t for the troops it wouldn\\'t have been just two \\ndays, there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \\nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \\nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \\nthem, \\'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we\\'ll come after you, too.\"\\n\\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \\nasked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \\nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We\\'ll finish that quickly. You\\'ll\\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we\\'ll decide later.\" The \\nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \\ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \\nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\\nas everyone knows, he\\'s the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \\nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \\nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn\\'t not say it, \\nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \\nand he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it\\'s\\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \\npunished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that\\'s a quote. Then one mother \\nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\\n\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \\nto calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \\ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \\nmust help us, because we don\\'t know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \\nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \\nsomeone saw something. Don\\'t be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \\nyou\\'re not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \\nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \\nabout, let\\'s say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \\nlater. We\\'re going to do it like this: We\\'re going to set up an urn and you \\ncan throw what you write in there. We don\\'t need to know who wrote it. The \\nnames of the people who write won\\'t be made public, but we need all the\\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \\nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \\ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \\nthe information into the urn.\"\\n\\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \\npeople who didn\\'t even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \\ncame up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won\\'t happen to you as \\nwill happen to me. So please . . . I\\'ll give you the information, and you \\nplease write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don\\'t know if \\nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \\ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can\\'t lie, thousands simply \\ncan\\'t lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \\nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\\n\\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \\nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \\none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \\nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \\nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \\npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \\nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \"Where were\\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you\\'re trying to convince us to \\nreturn, why didn\\'t you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \\nit was all leading?\" he says, \"You\\'re telling the truth. Let\\'s not mince \\nwords. You\\'ve told me right to my face, and I\\'ll tell you straight. I\\'ll tell \\nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \\ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \\n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \\nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\"\\nI say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \\nit?\" And he says, \"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \\nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \" I say, \"Fine, \\nyou didn\\'t know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \\nknown. Why did no one help us?\" And he says, \"Well, OK, we didn\\'t know what to\\ndo\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \\nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \\nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \\nAzerbaijanis . . . \" To this l answered, \"You know what . . . I\\'m speaking \\nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \\nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \\nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \" I asked him, \"What would you say about this\\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\" Then he said, \"Yes, I \\nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \\nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \\nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \\nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\"\\nAnd I say, \"There\\'s nothing to add to what really happened. I don\\'t think it\\'s\\npossible to add anything more awful.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree with you, I \\nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\" I repeat that he\\nsaid \"unfortunate occurrence.\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \\nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\\nand said, \"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \" I take this to mean that \\nhe really thinks it\\'s an \"unfortunate occurrence.\" \"And of course,\" he says, \\n\"I understand that having gone through all this you can\\'t return to Sumgait, \\nbut it\\'s necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \\ntried.\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don\\'t know if it matters or not, \\nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \\naffair.\\n\\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \\nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \"What, they didn\\'t\\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\" I was floored, I hadn\\'t imagined that\\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \\nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"I don\\'t know, \\nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors\\' pool. Be grateful if they don\\'t \\nput it down as unexcused absence.\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \\nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \\nthey\\'re telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \\nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\\nis Rasulov, and he\\'s had that position for many years. Incidentally, he\\'s a \\nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \\nsaid, \"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" He looked at me askance\\nand said, \"And why are you\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\"why did\\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" I say, \"What do you mean, why did I get \\nwrapped up in this mess? My husband\\'s an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \\nArmenian last name.\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \\nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \"I didn\\'t expect that you would\\n. . . \" What did he mean by that? And \"how\" should he behave, the chief of the\\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it\\'s true, there was a \\nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \\nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \\ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\\nHe\\'s going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \\nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\\n\\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I\\'m going back to Mamedov\\'s office when I asked \\nhim \"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \\nto Sumgait?\" he answered, \"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don\\'t\\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \\nwon\\'t guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" I say, \"So you\\'ve got another\\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they\\'ll be quiet and then \\nin another 50 years it\\'ll happen again?!\" I couldn\\'t contain myself any more,\\nand I also told him, \"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \\nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \\neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn\\'t you prepare people for this by the \\nway you treated them?\" And he says, \"You know, you\\'re finally starting to \\ninsult me!\" He threw his pen on the desk. \"Maybe now you\\'ll say I\\'m a \\nscoundrel too?\" I say, \"You know, I\\'m not talking about you because I don\\'t \\nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \\ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\\n\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \\nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \\ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \\n\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \\nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \\nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\\nSumgait.\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, \\'\\n\"Well, I walked down the street.\" And I said, \"Walking down the street in any \\ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\\nbecause I would be a guest, I don\\'t have any contact with people, but if you \\nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn\\'t \\nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you\\'d \\nhear something quite different.\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \\nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \\nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \\nthought maybe that in fact it wasn\\'t something general, of a mass nature, some\\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \\naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \\nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \\npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \\nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \\ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \\nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \\nwithdraw protection from the city altogether?

Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.\\n\\nOf course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.  \\nHowever, xstdcmap doesn\\'t seem to try very hard to avoid \\nconflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard \\ncolormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.  \\nSo it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very \\nproblem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps \\nif every application used standard colormaps, things would \\nbe wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use \\nstandard colormaps.\\n\\nFinally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation, \\nXmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent \\nwith the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.\\n\\n    According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):\\n\\n    For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and \\n    base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.  \\n    To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:\\n\\n            (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF\\n\\n    XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is \\n    used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c\\n    to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the \\n    call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is \\n    specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the \\n    total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59% \\n    of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.\\n    Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation \\n    to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.\\n\\n    When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap, \\n    defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult, \\n    and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3, \\n    one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.\\n\\n    When red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1, \\n    XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c, constructs \\n    a gray map. The sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives \\n    the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3, on would \\n    expect red_max to give the maximum gray value.\\n'),\n",

Where can i connect a 3 1/2\" AMP-Connector\\n>to supply my 3 1/2\" HD?\\n\\nIt is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any\\nmacintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came\\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\\n \\nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\\nover two months.\\n\\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don\\'t have a spare\\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\\nshorts or bad connections.\\n\\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn\\'t word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn\\'t work, my original cable is not\\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\\n\\nHaving done all that, I couldn\\'t be bothered to check the dev notes for\\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\\nday. \\n\\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID\\'s of\\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\\n\\nPeter Hansen\\nBell Northern Research\\npgmoffc@BNR.ca\\n'),\n",

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\\nin \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent time\\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope\\'s actual sampling\\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\\n\\nIs the HP scope you\\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\\n\\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\\nfall...\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n'),\n",

Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.\\nSeveral vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for \\ntheir workstations and X terminals.\\n\\n[last modified 10/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\\n\\nThere are several options for using X over serial lines:\\n\\nSLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\\npackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\\nand implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\\nMost X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \\never uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \\npacket and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \\nso; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \\n\\nCSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \\n40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn\\'t do \\nanything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\\nbut they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \\ndata through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\\n\\nPPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\\nlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\\nSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \\nline management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \\nrunning normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\\nstill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\\n\\nXRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\\ndeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \\nto using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \\nredundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \\nusing LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \\npseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \\nare several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\\n   (1)\\tYou don\\'t *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn\\'t \\n\\totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \\n\\tconnected), and\\n   (2)\\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\\n\\thave to cross the serial interface, and\\n   (3)\\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \\n\\tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \\n\\tblocks to compress.\\n\\nLBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\\nstandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \\nNCD\\'s XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\\nwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \\n(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \\netc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a \\nStandard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample \\nimplementation available in R6.\\n\\nAdditional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how\\nLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nin contrib/ in the following files:\\n        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote\\n        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX\\n\\n[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\\n\\n\\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton\\'s talk at\\nthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\\n\\n\\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the\\nX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is\\nno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways \\nfor the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,\\ndecoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order\\n(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\\n\\n\\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\\n\\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, \\nalthough it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\\n\\ttwm (old): Tom\\'s Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window \\nmanagers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a\\nre-parenting window manager. \\n\\tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers\\nsome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\\n\\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \\n\\trtl: Siemen\\'s window manager tiles windows so that they don\\'t overlap\\nand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\\n\\tdxwm: Digital\\'s dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\\n\\thpwm: HP\\'s window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\\n\\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\\n\\ttekwm: Tektronix\\'s window manager offering \\n\\tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style\\nGuide functionality\\n\\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\\n\\tgwm: Bull\\'s Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in\\nLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on\\navahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\\n\\tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\\n\\tpswm: Sun\\'s PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\\n\\tswm: Solbourne\\'s swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple\\nGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes\\nfrom the resources file\\n\\ttwm (new): MIT\\'s new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked\\ntwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\\n\\tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a\\nsingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available\\non archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available \\nfrom export. [3/92]\\n\\ttvtwm: Tom\\'s Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm\\nand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is\\navailable on archive servers\\n\\tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun\\'s olwm. It is \\navailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\\n\\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF\\'s mwm. A beta version\\nis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a \\nsource license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\\n\\tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \\n\\tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology\\'s terminals \\n\\tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur\\'s (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 \\ntwm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.\\nVersion 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\\n\\tvuewm: HP\\'s MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\\n\\t4Dwm: SGI\\'s enhanced MWM\\n\\tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\\n\\n\\tIt needn\\'t.  What is probably happening is that you are running your \\nwindow manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X \\nsession runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your \\nwindow manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in\\nthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\\n\\t\\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic\\nor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.\\nYour X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, \\nwhether or not you kill or restart your window manager.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\\n\\n\\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --\\nwhich may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the\\ngeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something \\nclose) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are \\nlooking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. \\nLook for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are \\nseveral versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.\\n[10/90]\\n\\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP\\'s vuewm provide for the \\nsaving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running\\napplications and the resource database. \\n[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]\\n \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC\\'s session manager?\\n\\n\\tDEC\\'s session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, \\nadd to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\\n\\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\\n\\n\\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The X\\nprotocol, however, doesn\\'t provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is\\na capability not supported by all systems.\\n\\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide\\ncommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over \\nserver start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the \\nserver with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server \\nfrom MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the \\nkeyboard.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\\n\\n\\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to be\\nproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful \\nfor moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and \\ndoes not do \"macro expansion.\"\\n\\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, \\naccept a translation resource such as:\\n\\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\\\\n\\t\\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\")\\nwhich permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally\\nwithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control\\ncharacters in the string, use \\\\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the\\ncontrol character you want to include.\\n\\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor\\nhas a special \"remapper\" client been made available.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDavid B.

The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.

It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)

It\\'s one\\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I\\'m sure, is that when people\\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\\n\\n       Unfortunately, that\\'s not the way things stack up.  The majority\\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \\nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \\nthemselves.  And why it\\'s popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\\nthe evidence doesn\\'t support this.  Internal studies, as well as\\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\\npeople jump off buildings.)\\n\\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \\nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn\\'t mean they\\nweren\\'t trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\\nkid might.\\n\\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there\\'s an enormous\\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\\nkilled.\\n\\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\\nbusinesses.)\\n\\n>Studies by the \\n>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence\\n>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member\\n>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.\"\\n\\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can\\'t comment.  I\\nwill point out Canada\\'s and Japan\\'s suicide rate as indications that\\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\\n\\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\\nit\\'s worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \\nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of\\nthe games he\\'s started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris\\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens\\' career ERA.

They performed well in two short series and won the\\nWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they\\nkeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky.

Mitchell\\n                          March 23, 1993\\n \\nINTRODUCTION:\\n \\nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\\npurposes.\\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\\ninformation\\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\\na\\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\\n \\nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\\nand\\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\\ninterfacing\\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\\nthe\\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\\nfacility\\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\\nconstruction\\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\\nby the users themselves.\\n \\nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\\n - art and theater\\n - bbs and online network users\\n - software and game developers\\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\\n - children\\n - the child in all of us\\n \\nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\\n \\nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\\nThe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\\nmachine-lets.\\n \\n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\\n \\n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\\n \\nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\\ndata link to LTM1.\\n \\nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\\nSSTO\\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\\nlandscape and land.\\n \\nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\\nworldwide\\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\\ncommercially\\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\\n \\nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\\n \\nPLAN OF ACTION:\\n \\nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\\nAn initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\\'s. A press release will be\\nissued\\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\\nmodels\\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\\n \\nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\\nbe\\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\\ntime\\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\\nto\\ntheir campus.\\n \\nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\\nwill\\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\\n \\nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\\nexperimentation\\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\\nlong\\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\\n \\nCONCLUSION:\\n \\nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\\nreal\\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\\'s minds in\\nspace.\\n \\n \\nMOONLIGHTERS:\\n \\n\"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\\n \\nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\\n \\nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.\\n\\n       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many\\nof the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective      \\nis commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about\\nthe use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that\\nMr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this\\nascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a \\ndescriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have\\nused it in the past.\\n\\n\\n      The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don\\'t feel compelled to\\ndiscuss Mr. King\\'s racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would\\nnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would\\nnot have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call\\nto make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.  \\n\\n      I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than\\nme using the adjective \\'black\\' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have\\nbeen happier if I had used \\'African-american\\' ?  If so, then you really are\\nlost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting one\\npersons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my \\nmessage to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.\\n\\n     The way you went about this \\'polite\\' inquiry makes me believe it was \\nanything but.\\n \\n\\n'),\n",

Also, in most \\ninstances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more \\nperformance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on.\\nThe mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at \\n2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of \\nthe slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose\\nto but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure...\\nAnyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound,\\nwhich is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario \\nslip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full \\nthrottle.\\n\\nJust remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or\\nexhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may\\nhave to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust\\nsystem, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point\\nwhich re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping\\nprofile.\\n\\nTalk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if\\nthey have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have the\\nsystem also to see what they think about there slip on.\\n\\nAlso, as a last data point, in Sport Rider\\'s first issue, did a review on a\\ngroup of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a \\nside bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at\\nthe rear wheel, 85 verses 91. \\n\\nBuyer beware, of outrageous claimed increases in horse power!

If\\nyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will\\nnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. \\nThe fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle\\n(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of\\nthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!\\n\\nIt used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for\\nan officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many\\nlaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. \\nRight, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF\\nfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \"no way!\" \\nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\\ndetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\\n\\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\\n\\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\\nenlightment may be necessary.\\n\\nSo, the questions are -\\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\\n  antenna?\\n  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?\\n\\n==============================================================================\\nRandy T.

The garage is Unheated.  \\nThey were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding\\nlawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the \\nriding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries \\nwas new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered\\nthat all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all\\nworked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced \\nabout halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored\\nin the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)\\n  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.\\none is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and\\ndiscovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries\\ndead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said \"HMMMMMMMM\" and \\nthe amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)\\nthe internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They\\nwere the same.  \\n   Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead\\nacid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only\\nneeded a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them\\nby using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they\\nworked fine for around 25 of \\'em. \\n  This leads me to believe one of several things.\\n     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)\\n     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the\\n        batteries.\\n     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the \\n          room where the concrete is, \\n     4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air\\n         better than concrete.\\n\\n(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)  \\n\\n   Any other ideas?\\n    *could be the aliens, anything is possible.*\\n \\n'),\n",

Rushdie was writing\\nabout a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing\\nthe actor \"Gibreel\" in the role of the angel whose name he took.\\nRushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims\\nor implies that this is what actually happened.  It\\'s somewhat like\\nstories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed\\nprostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).

If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,\\nconsider Salman Rushdie\\'s children\\'s book \"Haroun and the Sea of\\nStories\" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific\\nstoryteller -- works with existing story lines.\\n\\n>to ridicule Muhammad\\'s integrity...\\n\\nNo.  Muhammad\\'s [Mahound\\'s] integrity is not really impugned in this\\npart of the story, and there\\'s no reason to think this was Rushdie\\'s\\nintent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and\\nsatanic), though he doesn\\'t know their provenance.

Is it Satan?\\nOr something else?  The answer is not given.\\n\\nTo be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the\\nrole of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss\\nof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,\\nbut this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very\\nexistence of a newsgroup named \"alt.atheism\" raises the same\\nquestions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is\\nthe real relevance.

This \"disobedience\"\\n#>brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from\\n#>their lands and settlements...\\n#\\n#It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by\\n#\"average\" people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty\\n#homogeonously Christian. It was largely the mainstream Christian\\'s disgust\\n#at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.\\n\\nTrue, but that is exactly the \"problem\": the Mormon extermination order\\nwas issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution\\nof the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents\\nlike this \"order\" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in\\nan earlier posting, your \"irrational hatred\" is clearly evidenced by\\nindividuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs\\' Lieutenant;\\nhe would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day\\noccurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,\\nlies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.\\n\\nIn intent and purpose, what really has changed?\\n\\n#The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings\\n#and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don\\'t think most of them\\n#are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and\\n#perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification\\n#which discourages critical thought.\\n\\nTrue, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you\\'re aware.\\n\\n#>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and\\n#>I don\\'t even discuss how Uthan\\'s were suckered into allowing part of their\\n#>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from\\n#>being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I\\n#>may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the\\n#>case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church\\n#>leader) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-\"Peace Keeper\"\\n#>missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another \"inspired\" decision from\\n#secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough\\n#for the feds to back off.\\n#\\n#Do you mean that the \"secular authorities\" are some continuous group of\\n#people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the\\n#Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for\\n#nuclear testing etc.. was to \"get them thar Mormons\"?  And what about the\\n#majority of Uthan\\'s who aren\\'t Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy\\n ^^^^^^^^\\n(Correction: the majority of Utahn\\'s ARE Mormon (60-70% I believe, up to a\\n 100% in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states.)\\n\\n#conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you\\n#badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe\\nthat Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert\\ntruth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary\\nhas power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be\\na good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and\\nevil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don\\'t you suppose that the\\ndestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?\\n\\nAs far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples\\nof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have\\nbrought death, disease, (i.e. the \"downwinders\") and environmental contami-\\nnation.  I am hardly \"paranoid,\" I am just not \"expecting\" too much from a\\nsecular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed\\n(as Gov. Boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.  As a matter of\\nfact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global)\\npersecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that\\n(paraphrasing) \"all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must\\nflee to Zion.\"  Zion (the \"pure in heart\") will be re-established in those\\ndays, and it AIN\\'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it...\\n\\n#>...

However,\\n\\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\\n\\n   The Mode of Removal\\n   -------------------\\n\\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\\n\\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\\n\\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\\n   and city quarters.\\n\\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \\nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\\ntheir action as follows:\\n\\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\\n   torture you.\"\\n\\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\\n\\n\\n>>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\\n>>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\\n>>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\\n>>relations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is \\n>>anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.\\n>>\\n>>To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply\\n>>they are not separate peoples.  ....\\n>\\n>\\tHow touching.

Explain yourself, or withdraw your claim.\\n\\n>\\tCroats from Croatia mostly had no contacts with Muslims, since they\\n>\\twere mostly \"dealt with extreme preudice\" long time ago. However \\n>\\tone of the main agendas is turning Bosnia into purely Catholic state.\\n\\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \\nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \\n\\n>\\tI should add few more things.  A.J. Evans, in his \"On Foot Through\\n>\\tB&H\" describes that Catholic clergy in the last century was \\n>\\tapparently more scared by Serbs, then by Turks, because Serbs were\\n>\\tgrowing stronger and, unlike Turks, represented great danger for\\n>\\tidea of Catholic Bosnia.

Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\\nunstable.  I\\'m working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \\nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \\n\\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \\nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \\nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\\nIf not, then all bets are off.\\n\\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I\\'m deeply hurt.\\nThis is not about some \"image\" but about survival of a concept of a\\npartnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats\\nand Muslims.  \\n\\nSigh...\\nJosip\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation\\n   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult\\n   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit\\n   of idiocy is that if you\\'re going to operate as a quasi-military unit,\\n   you\\'d better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule\\n   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is\\n   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.\\n\\n2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were\\n   outgunned, they didn\\'t expect such heavy resistance.  When\\n   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault\\n   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were\\n   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew\\n   you could!\\n\\n3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,\\n   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and\\n   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I\\'m\\n   more than ever convinced that\\'s right on target.  An anecdote not\\n   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up\\n   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There\\'s\\n   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by\\n   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I\\n   was told this by a relative of my wife\\'s who happens to be an FBI\\n   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let\\'s just say\\n   uncomplimentary.\\n\\n4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that\\n   the BD\\'s had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the\\n   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we\\'re *still* hearing\\n   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references\\n   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around\\n   the \"He\\'s a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\"\\n   flag.  Sigh.\\n\\n5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege\\n   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought\\n   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button\\n   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My\\n   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to\\n   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to\\n   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in\\n   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I\\'d expect the\\n   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In\\n   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones\\n   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:\\n   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and\\n   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the\\n   BD\\'s feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have\\n   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it\\n   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh\\'s\\n   paranoid delusions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n\\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>\\n\\nDan S.\\n'),\n",

No, that has \\nsocioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a \\ndysfunction.\\n\\nBasically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that\\nsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to\\ndeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african\\namericans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be\\nthat the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has\\na very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.\\nNon african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they \\nare so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good \\nhard look at the thing we say are doing us damage.

Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming\\nthey didn\\'t cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one\\nfile should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate\\nsaid offset in the original directory and see what\\'s there using a hex\\neditor, and do the same for the modified one.\\n\\n6.  You\\'re on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don\\'t\\nreally do cryptography.  It\\'s probably just an xor key or something; I\\nthink MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing\\nhis copy than with \"real pirates\" who will probably just disassemble\\nthe damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about\\nany obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original\\nfloppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able\\nto back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a\\ncompare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).\\n\\nAs I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and\\ndon\\'t do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one\\ndirectory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff\\nI\\'ve mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if\\nthey\\'d ever find out.

I think that some\\nare cruel, depending on the nature and duration of the pain.\\n\\n>By the way, how long is too long?\\n\\nAnything more than an instant, I guess.  Any death by suffocation\\nasphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, I think (this includes the\\ngas chamber, and drawing and quartering).  I\\'d say that any pain that\\nlasts, say, over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may\\nbe an arbitrary cutoff, I suppose).\\n\\nkeith\\n'),\n",
